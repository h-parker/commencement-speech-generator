00:10
Please visit us at stanford.edu
00:22
Thank You. I am honored to be with you today at your commencement
00:30
from one of the finest universities in the world.
00:35
Truth be told I never graduated from college
00:41
and this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.
00:47
Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it.
00:52
No big deal. Just three stories.
00:55
The first story is about connecting the dots.
01:01
I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months,
01:03
but then stayed around as a drop-in
01:05
for another 18 months or so before I really quit.
01:09
So why did I drop out?
01:12
It started before I was born.
01:15
My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student,
01:19
and she decided to put me up for adoption.
01:22
She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates,
01:26
so everything was all set for me to
01:28
be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife.
01:31
Except that when I popped out they decided
01:34
at the last minute that they really wanted a girl.
01:37
So my parents, who were on a waiting list,
01:40
got a call in the middle of the night asking: "We have an unexpected
01:44
baby boy; do you want him?"
01:47
They said: "Of course." My biological mother later found out that
01:53
my mother had never graduated from college
01:55
and that my father had never graduated from high school.
01:59
She refused to sign the final adoption papers.
02:03
She only relented a few months later when
02:05
my parents promised that I would go to college. This was the start in my life.
02:12
And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college
02:19
that was almost as expensive as Stanford,
02:22
and all of my working-class parents'
02:24
savings were being spent on my college tuition.
02:27
After six months, I couldn't see the value in it.
02:30
I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life
02:32
and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out.
02:36
And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved
02:40
their entire life.
02:42
So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK.
02:46
It was pretty scary at the time,
02:49
but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made.
02:54
The minute I dropped out I could stop
02:56
taking the required classes that didn't interest me,
02:59
and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.
03:04
It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room,
03:08
so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms,
03:10
I returned coke bottles for the 5 cent deposits to buy food with,
03:14
and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday
03:17
night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna
03:21
temple. I loved it.
03:23
And much of what I stumbled into by following
03:26
my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.
03:29
Let me give you one example: Reed College at that
03:34
time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country.
03:38
Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer,
03:42
was beautifully hand calligraphed.
03:45
Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes,
03:49
I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this.
03:53
I learned about serif and san serif typefaces,
03:56
about varying the amount of space
03:57
between different letter combinations,
03:59
about what makes great typography great.
04:03
It was beautiful, historical,
04:05
artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture,
04:09
and I found it fascinating.
04:12
None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life.
04:17
But ten years later,
04:18
when we were designing the first Macintosh computer,
04:21
it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac.
04:25
It was the first computer with beautiful typography.
04:29
If I had never dropped in on that single course in college,
04:32
the Mac would have never had multiple
04:34
typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.
04:37
And since Windows just copied the Mac,
04:39
it's likely that no personal computer would have them.
04:47
If I had never dropped out,
04:51
I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class,
04:54
and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography
04:57
that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect
05:00
the dots looking forward when I was in college.
05:02
But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later.
05:07
Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward;
05:10
you can only connect them looking backwards.
05:12
So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect
05:15
in your future.
05:16
You have to trust in something, your gut, destiny, life, karma,
05:20
whatever.
05:22
Beleiveing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart
05:28
Even when it leads you off the well worn path, and that will make all the difference.
05:38
My second story is about love and loss.
05:44
I was lucky I found what I loved to do early in life.
05:48
Woz and I started Apple in my parents garage when I was 20.
05:51
We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of
05:55
us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees.
05:59
We had just released our finest creation the Macintosh
06:03
a year earlier, and I had just turned 30.
06:06
And then I got fired.
06:09
How can you get fired from a company you started?
06:12
Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought
06:15
was very talented to run the company with me,
06:18
and for the first year or so things went well.
06:20
But then our visions of the future began
06:22
to diverge and eventually we had a falling out.
06:25
When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him.
06:29
So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out.
06:32
What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone,
06:35
and it was devastating.
06:38
I really didn't know what to do for a few months.
06:41
I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs
06:43
down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me.
06:47
I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce
06:50
and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly.
06:54
I was a very public failure,
06:55
and I even thought about running away from the valley.
06:58
But something slowly began to dawn on me I still loved what I did.
07:03
The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit.
07:07
I had been rejected, but I was still in love.
07:12
And so I decided to start over.
07:14
I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from
07:17
Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.
07:21
The heaviness of being successful was
07:23
replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again,
07:26
less sure about everything.
07:27
It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.
07:31
During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT,
07:34
another company named Pixar,
07:35
and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife.
07:39
Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature
07:42
film, Toy Story,
07:44
and is now the most successful animation studio in the world.
07:49
In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT,
07:53
I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at
07:56
NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance.
07:59
And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.
08:03
I'm pretty sure none of this would
08:05
have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple.
08:08
It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it.
08:12
Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith.
08:18
I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved
08:21
what I did. You've got to find what you love.
08:24
And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers.
08:28
Your work is going to fill a large part of your life,
08:30
and the only way to be truly satisfied
08:32
is to do what you believe is great work.
08:35
And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.
08:38
If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.
08:43
As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.
08:47
And, like any great relationship,
08:49
it just gets better and better as the years roll on.
08:52
So keep looking. Don't settle.
09:05
My third story is about death.
09:09
When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like:
09:12
"If you live each day as if it was your last,
09:15
someday you'll most certainly be right."
09:20
It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years,
09:25
I have looked in the mirror every morning
09:27
and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life,
09:30
would I want to do what I am about to do today?"
09:34
And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row,
09:37
I know I need to change something.
09:40
Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important
09:43
tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.
09:47
Because almost everything all external expectations, all pride,
09:52
all fear of embarrassment or failure -
09:54
these things just fall away in the face of death,
09:58
leaving only what is truly important.
10:00
Remembering that you are going to die is the best
10:03
way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.
10:08
You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.
10:13
About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer.
10:16
I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning,
10:20
and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas.
10:23
I didn't even know what a pancreas was.
10:26
The doctors told me this was almost
10:28
certainly a type of cancer that is incurable,
10:30
and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months.
10:35
My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order,
10:40
which is doctor's code for prepare to die.
10:42
It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought
10:47
you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months.
10:51
It means to make sure everything is buttoned
10:53
up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family.
10:56
It means to say your goodbyes.
11:01
I lived with that diagnosis all day.
11:04
Later that evening I had a biopsy,
11:06
where they stuck an endoscope down my throat,
11:08
through my stomach and into my intestines,
11:11
put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor.
11:14
I was sedated, but my wife, who was there,
11:18
told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope
11:21
the doctors started crying because it turned out to be
11:24
a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery.
11:29
I had the surgery and thankfully I'm fine now.
11:40
This was the closest I've been to facing death,
11:43
and I hope its the closest I get for a few more decades.
11:46
Having lived through it,
11:48
I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when
11:51
death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:
11:55
No one wants to die.
11:58
Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there.
12:02
And yet death is the destination we all share.
12:06
No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be,
12:10
because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life.
12:15
It is Life's change agent.
12:16
It clears out the old to make way for the new.
12:19
Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now,
12:24
you will gradually become the old and be cleared away.
12:28
Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.
12:32
Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.
12:38
Don't be trapped by dogma which is living
12:40
with the results of other people's thinking.
12:42
Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner
12:46
voice. And most important,
12:48
have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.
12:51
They somehow already know what you truly want to become.
12:55
Everything else is secondary.
13:09
When I was young,
13:11
there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog,
13:15
which was one of the bibles of my generation.
13:18
It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here
13:21
in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch.
13:25
This was in the late 1960's,
13:27
before personal computers and desktop publishing,
13:30
so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras.
13:34
It was sort of like Google in paperback form,
13:36
35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic,
13:41
overflowing with neat tools, and great notions.
13:45
Stewart and his team put out several
13:47
issues of The Whole Earth Catalog,
13:48
and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue.
13:53
It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age.
13:58
On the back cover of their final issue
14:00
was a photograph of an early morning country road,
14:04
the kind you might find yourself
14:05
hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous.
14:08
Beneath it were the words: "Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish."
14:13
It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry.
14:18
Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself.
14:23
And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.
14:28
Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.
14:31
Thank you all very much."""

obama = """Thank you so much.
00:02
(Applause.)
00:03
Thank you.
00:11
Please,
00:12
please have a seat.
00:14
Thank you.
00:17
(Applause.)
00:19
Thank you,
00:21
President Spar, trustees,
00:23
President Bollinger.
00:25
Hello, Class of 2012! (Applause.)
00:37
Congratulations on reaching this day.
00:40
Thank you for the honor of being able to be a part of it.
00:44
There are so many people who are proud of you --
00:50
your parents, family, faculty, friends~
00:53
all who share in this achievement.
00:57
So please give them a big round of applause.
00:59
(Applause.) To all the moms who are here today,
01:09
you could not ask for a better Mother’s Day gift
01:11
than to see all of these folks graduate.
01:15
(Applause.)
01:19
I have to say, though,
01:21
whenever I come to these things,
01:22
I start thinking about Malia and Sasha graduating,
01:24
and I start tearing up and~
01:26
(laughter)~ It’s terrible.
01:28
I don’t know how you guys are
01:30
holding it together.
01:32
(Laughter.)
01:34
I will begin by telling a hard truth:
01:37
I’m a Columbia college graduate.
01:40
(Laughter and applause.)
01:44
I know there can be a little bit of a sibling rivalry here.
01:50
(Laughter.) But I’m honored nevertheless
01:53
to be your commencement speaker today~
01:55
although I’ve got to say,
01:57
you set a pretty high bar
02:01
given the past three years.
02:04
(Applause.) Hillary Clinton --
02:14
(applause)~ Meryl Streep~
02:15
(applause)~ Sheryl Sandberg~
02:17
these are not easy acts to follow.
02:20
(Applause.)But I will point out Hillary
02:22
is doing an extraordinary job as
02:23
one of the finest Secretaries of State
02:24
America has ever had.(Applause.)
02:30
We gave Meryl the Presidential Medal
02:32
of Arts and Humanities.(Applause.)
02:37
Sheryl is not just a good friend;
02:39
she’s also one of our economic advisers.
02:41
So it’s like the old saying goes~
02:43
keep your friends close,
02:44
and your Barnard commencement speakers
02:47
even closer. (Applause.)
02:55
There’s wisdom in that.
02:59
(Laughter.) Now,
03:00
the year I graduated~
03:02
this area looks familiar~
03:05
(laughter)~
03:06
the year I graduated was 1983,
03:08
the first year women were admitted to Columbia.
03:14
(Applause.) Sally Ride was the first American woman in space.
03:18
Music was all about Michael and the Moonwalk.
03:22
(Laughter.)AUDIENCE MEMBER: Do it! (Laughter.)
03:24
THE PRESIDENT: No Moonwalking.
03:31
(Laughter.) No Moonwalking today.
03:38
(Laughter.) We had the Walkman, not iPods.
03:46
Some of the streets around here
03:48
were not quite so inviting.
03:52
(Laughter.) Times Square was not
03:54
a family destination.
03:57
(Laughter.) So I know this is all ancient history.
04:00
Nothing worse than commencement speakers
04:04
droning on about bygone days.
04:08
(Laughter.) But for all the differences,
04:12
the Class of 1983 actually had
04:14
a lot in common with all of you.
04:17
For we, too, were heading out
04:19
into a world at a moment when
04:20
our country was still recovering
04:22
from a particularly severe economic recession.
04:27
It was a time of change.
04:29
It was a time of uncertainty.
04:31
It was a time of passionate political debates.
04:37
You can relate to this because
04:41
just as you were starting out finding
04:43
your way around this campus,
04:45
an economic crisis struck that would
04:47
claim more than 5 million jobs
04:49
before the end of your freshman year.
04:52
Since then, some of you have probably
04:55
seen parents put off retirement,
04:58
friends struggle to find work.
05:02
And you may be looking toward the future
05:04
with that same sense of concern that
05:07
my generation did when we were
05:09
sitting where you are now.
05:12
Of course, as young women,
05:15
you’re also going to grapple
05:16
with some unique challenges,
05:17
like whether you’ll be able to earn
05:19
equal pay for equal work;
05:21
whether you’ll be able to balance
05:22
the demands of your job and your family;
05:25
whether you’ll be able to fully control
05:27
decisions about your own health.
05:29
And while opportunities for women
05:32
have grown exponentially over the last 30 years,
05:37
as young people,
05:39
in many ways you have it even tougher than we did.
05:42
This recession has been more brutal,
05:45
the job losses steeper.
05:48
Politics seems nastier.
05:51
Congress more gridlocked than ever.
05:55
Some folks in the financial world have
05:56
not exactly been model corporate citizens.
06:02
(Laughter.)
06:04
No wonder that faith in our institutions
06:08
has never been lower,
06:11
particularly when good news
06:14
doesn’t get the same kind of ratings
06:15
as bad news anymore.
06:16
Every day you receive a steady stream
06:19
of sensationalism and scandal and stories
06:21
with a message that suggest change isn’t possible;
06:27
that you can’t make a difference;
06:30
that you won’t be able to close that gap
06:31
between life as it is and life as you want it to be.
06:37
My job today is to tell you don’t believe it.
06:41
Because as tough as things have been,
06:46
I am convinced you are tougher.
06:51
I’ve seen your passion and I’ve seen your service.
06:55
I’ve seen you engage and I’ve seen
06:58
you turn out in record numbers.
07:00
I’ve heard your voices amplified
07:02
by creativity and a digital fluency that those
07:05
of us in older generations can barely comprehend.
07:09
I’ve seen a generation eager,
07:13
impatient even,
07:16
to step into the rushing waters
07:18
of history and change its course.
07:22
And that defiant,
07:24
can-do spirit is what runs through
07:26
the veins of American history.
07:29
It’s the lifeblood of all our progress.
07:33
And it is that spirit which we need
07:35
your generation to embrace and rekindle right now.
07:45
See, the question is not
07:46
whether things will get better~
07:49
they always do.
07:51
The question is not whether
07:53
we’ve got the solutions to our challenges~
07:56
we’ve had them within our grasp for quite some time.
08:01
We know, for example,
08:02
that this country would be better off
08:03
if more Americans were able to get
08:05
the kind of education that you’ve received here at Barnard~
08:08
(applause)~
08:16
if more people could get
08:18
the specific skills and training that
08:19
employers are looking for today.
08:23
We know that we’d all be better off
08:25
if we invest in science and technology
08:27
that sparks new businesses and medical breakthroughs;
08:30
if we developed more clean energy
08:32
so we could use less foreign oil and
08:34
reduce the carbon pollution that’s threatening our planet.
08:37
(Applause.) We know that we’re better off
08:45
when there are rules that stop big banks
08:47
from making bad bets with other people’s money and~
08:50
(applause)~
08:53
when insurance companies aren’t
08:54
allowed to drop your coverage when
08:56
you need it most or charge women differently from men.
09:06
(Applause.) Indeed,
09:07
we know we are better off when women
09:09
are treated fairly and equally in every aspect
09:12
of American life — whether it’s the salary you earn or the health decisions you make.
09:25
(Applause.) We know these things to be true.
09:28
We know that our challenges are eminently solvable.
09:33
The question is whether together,
09:35
we can muster the will — in our own lives,
09:40
in our common institutions,
09:43
in our politics — to bring about the changes we need.
09:50
And I’m convinced your generation possesses that will.
09:57
And I believe that the women of this generation
09:59
— that all of you will help lead the way.
10:03
(Applause.)Now, I recognize
10:09
that’s a cheap applause line when
10:12
you’re giving a commencement at Barnard.
10:14
(Laughter.) It’s the easy thing to say.
10:17
But it’s true.
10:19
It is — in part,
10:21
it is simple math.
10:23
Today, women are not just half
10:25
this country; you’re half its workforce.
10:30
(Applause.) More and more women are out-earning their husbands.
10:33
You’re more than half of our college graduates,
10:36
and master’s graduates,
10:37
and PhDs.
10:44
(Applause.) So you’ve got us outnumbered.
10:52
(Laughter.) After decades of slow,
10:54
steady,
10:55
extraordinary progress,
10:56
you are now poised to make this the
10:59
century where women shape not only
11:01
their own destiny but the destiny of
11:03
this nation and of this world.
11:07
But how far your leadership takes this country,
11:10
how far it takes this world — well,
11:13
that will be up to you.
11:15
You’ve got to want it.
11:18
It will not be handed to you.
11:21
And as someone who wants that future
11:23
— that better future — for you,
11:26
and for Malia and Sasha,
11:29
as somebody who’s had the good fortune
11:31
of being the husband and the father
11:33
and the son of some strong,
11:35
remarkable women,
11:37
allow me to offer just a few pieces of advice.
11:43
That’s obligatory.
11:44
(Laughter.) Bear with me.
11:47
My first piece of advice is this: Don’t just get involved.
11:52
Fight for your seat at the table.
11:55
Better yet,
11:57
fight for a seat at the head of the table.
12:00
(Applause.)
12:08
It’s been said that the most important
12:10
role in our democracy is the role of citizen.
12:13
And indeed,
12:14
it was 225 years ago today that
12:18
the Constitutional Convention opened in Philadelphia,
12:20
and our founders, citizens all,
12:23
began crafting an extraordinary document.
12:28
Yes, it had its flaws — flaws that this nation has strived
12:32
to protect (perfect) over time.
12:36
Questions of race and gender were unresolved.
12:40
No woman’s signature graced the original document
12:43
— although we can assume that there were
12:44
founding mothers whispering smarter things
12:47
in the ears of the founding fathers.
12:50
(Applause.) I mean,
12:53
that’s almost certain.
12:55
What made this document special
12:59
was that it provided the space — the possibility~
13:02
for those who had been left out of our charter to fight their way in.
13:09
It provided people the language to
13:12
appeal to principles and ideals that
13:15
broadened democracy’s reach.
13:18
It allowed for protest,
13:20
and movements,
13:22
and the dissemination of new ideas that would repeatedly,
13:25
decade after decade,
13:26
change the world — a constant forward
13:29
movement that continues to this day.
13:33
Our founders understood that America
13:36
does not stand still; we are dynamic,
13:41
not static.
13:42
We look forward,
13:43
not back.
13:45
And now that new doors have been opened for you,
13:49
you’ve got an obligation to seize those opportunities.
13:55
You need to do this not just for yourself
13:58
but for those who don’t yet enjoy the choices that you’ve had,
14:03
the choices you will have.
14:05
And one reason many workplaces
14:07
still have outdated policies is because women
14:10
only account for 3 percent of the CEOs at
14:12
Fortune 500 companies.
14:16
One reason we’re actually refighting
14:18
long-settled battles over women’s
14:20
rights is because women occupy fewer than
14:22
one in five seats in Congress.
14:26
Now,
14:27
I’m not saying that the only way
14:28
to achieve success is by climbing
14:31
to the top of the corporate ladder
14:32
or running for office — although,
14:34
let’s face it,
14:35
Congress would get a lot more done if you did.
14:38
(Laughter and applause.) That I think we’re sure about.
14:47
But if you decide not to sit yourself at the table,
14:52
at the very least you’ve got to make sure
14:54
you have a say in who does.
14:57
It matters.
15:00
Before women like Barbara Mikulski
15:02
and Olympia Snowe and others got to Congress,
15:06
just to take one example,
15:07
much of federally funded research
15:08
on diseases focused solely on their effects on men.
15:15
It wasn’t until women like Patsy Mink
15:17
and Edith Green got to Congress
15:19
and passed Title IX,
15:20
40 years ago this year,
15:22
that we declared women, too,
15:23
should be allowed to compete
15:25
and win on America’s playing fields.
15:35
(Applause.) Until a woman named
15:36
Lilly Ledbetter showed up at her office
15:38
and had the courage to step up and say,
15:40
you know what,
15:41
this isn’t right,
15:42
women weren’t being treated fairly —
15:43
we lacked some of the tools we
15:46
needed to uphold the basic principle
15:48
of equal pay for equal work.
15:52
So don’t accept somebody else’s
15:53
construction of the way things ought to be.
15:56
It’s up to you to right wrongs.
15:58
It’s up to you to point out injustice.
16:00
It’s up to you to hold the system
16:02
accountable and sometimes upend it entirely.
16:07
It’s up to you to stand up and to be heard,
16:10
to write and to lobby,
16:11
to march,
16:12
to organize,
16:13
to vote.
16:16
Don’t be content to just sit back and watch.
16:20
Those who oppose change,
16:23
those who benefit from an unjust status quo,
16:25
have always bet on the public’s cynicism
16:28
or the public’s complacency.
16:31
Throughout American history,
16:32
though, they have lost that bet,
16:35
and I believe they will this time as well.
16:46
(Applause.) But ultimately,
16:47
Class of 2012,
16:48
that will depend on you.
16:50
Don’t wait for the person next to you
16:52
to be the first to speak up for what’s right.
16:55
Because maybe,
16:56
just maybe,
16:58
they’re waiting on you.
17:01
Which brings me to my second piece of advice:
17:03
Never underestimate the power of your example.
17:08
The very fact that you are graduating,
17:10
let alone that more women now
17:12
graduate from college than men,
17:14
is only possible because earlier
17:15
generations of women — your mothers,
17:18
your grandmothers,
17:19
your aunts — shattered the myth
17:21
that you couldn’t or shouldn’t be where you are.
17:27
(Applause.)I think of a friend of mine who’s
17:34
the daughter of immigrants.
17:35
When she was in high school,
17:37
her guidance counselor told her,
17:39
you know what,
17:41
you’re just not college material.
17:43
You should think about becoming a secretary.
17:46
Well, she was stubborn,
17:48
so she went to college anyway.
17:50
She got her master’s.
17:51
She ran for local office, won.
17:52
She ran for state office, she won.
17:54
She ran for Congress, she won.
17:57
And lo and behold,
17:59
Hilda Solis did end up becoming a secretary
18:03
— (laughter) — she is America’s
18:04
Secretary of Labor.(Applause.)
18:17
So think about what that means
18:18
to a young Latina girl when she sees a
18:21
Cabinet secretary that looks like her.
18:25
(Applause.) Think about what
18:27
it means to a young girl in Iowa
18:28
when she sees a presidential candidate
18:30
who looks like her.
18:32
Think about what it means to
18:33
a young girl walking in Harlem
18:35
right down the street when she sees a U.N.
18:37
ambassador who looks like her.
18:40
Do not underestimate the power of your example.
18:43
This diploma opens up new possibilities,
18:47
so reach back,
18:49
convince a young girl to earn one, too.
18:52
If you earned your degree in areas
18:54
where we need more women —
18:56
like computer science or engineering —
18:59
(applause) — reach back and persuade
19:02
another student to study it, too.
19:05
If you’re going into fields where we need more women,
19:07
like construction or computer engineering — reach back,
19:09
hire someone new.
19:12
Be a mentor.
19:14
Be a role model.
19:17
Until a girl can imagine herself,
19:18
can picture herself as a computer programmer,
19:22
or a combatant commander,
19:25
she won’t become one.
19:26
Until there are women who tell her,
19:28
ignore our pop culture obsession
19:30
over beauty and fashion — (applause) —
19:32
and focus instead on studying and
19:37
inventing and competing and leading,
19:41
she’ll think those are the only things
19:42
that girls are supposed to care about.
19:44
Now, Michelle will say,
19:45
nothing wrong with caring about it a little bit.
19:49
(Laughter.) You can be stylish and powerful, too.
19:54
(Applause.) That’s Michelle’s advice.
20:04
(Applause.)
20:05
And never forget that the most
20:06
important example a young girl
20:07
will ever follow is that of a parent.
20:12
Malia and Sasha are going to be outstanding
20:14
women because Michelle and Marian Robinson
20:18
are outstanding women.
20:20
So understand your power,
20:23
and use it wisely.
20:27
My last piece of advice — this is simple,
20:30
but perhaps most important: Persevere.
20:34
Persevere.
20:38
Nothing worthwhile is easy.
20:42
No one of achievement has avoided failure
20:45
— sometimes catastrophic failures.
20:49
But they keep at it.
20:52
They learn from mistakes.
20:53
They don’t quit.
20:57
You know,
20:58
when I first arrived on this campus,
21:00
it was with little money,
21:01
fewer options.
21:04
But it was here that I tried to find my place in this world.
21:07
I knew I wanted to make a difference,
21:08
but it was vague how in fact I’d go about it.
21:15
(Laughter.) But I wanted to do my part
21:18
to do my part to shape a better world.
21:22
So even as I worked after graduation
21:25
in a few unfulfilling jobs here in New York —
21:27
I will not list them all — (laughter) —
21:29
even as I went from motley apartment to motley apartment,
21:37
I reached out.
21:38
I started to write letters to community
21:40
organizations all across the country.
21:42
And one day,
21:43
a small group of churches on the South Side of Chicago answered,
21:46
offering me work with people in
21:50
neighborhoods hit hard by steel mills
21:52
that were shutting down and communities
21:55
where jobs were dying away.
22:00
The community had been plagued by gang violence,
22:02
so once I arrived,
22:03
one of the first things we tried to
22:04
do was to mobilize a meeting with
22:06
community leaders to deal with gangs.
22:09
And I’d worked for weeks on this project.
22:10
We invited the police; we made
22:11
phone calls; we went to churches; we passed out flyers.
22:15
The night of the meeting we
22:16
arranged rows and rows of
22:18
chairs in anticipation of this crowd.
22:21
And we waited,
22:23
and we waited.
22:25
And finally,
22:26
a group of older folks walked in to the hall and they sat down.
22:28
And this little old lady raised her hand and asked,
22:30
“Is this where the bingo game is?” (Laughter.) It was a disaster.
22:41
Nobody showed up.
22:44
My first big community meeting
22:45
— nobody showed up.
22:49
And later,
22:50
the volunteers I worked with told me,
22:52
that’s it; we’re quitting.
22:54
They’d been doing this for two
22:56
years even before I had arrived.
22:57
They had nothing to show for it.
22:58
And I’ll be honest,
23:00
I felt pretty discouraged as well.
23:01
I didn’t know what I was doing.
23:02
I thought about quitting.
23:03
And as we were talking,
23:04
I looked outside and saw some
23:06
young boys playing in a vacant
23:08
lot across the street.
23:09
And they were just throwing rocks up at a boarded building.
23:12
They had nothing better to do — late at night,
23:17
just throwing rocks.
23:19
And I said to the volunteers,
23:20
“Before you quit,
23:21
answer one question.
23:23
What will happen to those boys if you quit?
23:27
Who will fight for them if we don’t?
23:28
Who will give them a fair shot if we leave?
23:39
And one by one,
23:41
the volunteers decided not to quit.
23:42
We went back to those neighborhoods and we kept at it.
23:44
We registered new voters,
23:45
and we set up after-school programs,
23:46
and we fought for new jobs,
23:48
and helped people live lives with some measure of dignity.
23:51
And we sustained ourselves with those small victories.
23:54
We didn’t set the world on fire.
23:57
Some of those communities are still very poor.
24:01
There are still a lot of gangs out there.
24:03
But I believe that it was those
24:05
small victories that helped me win the
24:07
bigger victories of my last three
24:10
and a half years as President.
24:12
And I wish I could say that
24:13
this perseverance came from
24:15
some innate toughness in me.
24:17
But the truth is,
24:18
it was learned.
24:20
I got it from watching the people who raised me.
24:24
More specifically,
24:25
I got it from watching the women who shaped my life.
24:31
I grew up as the son of a single mom
24:34
who struggled to put herself through
24:36
school and make ends meet.
24:38
She had marriages that fell apart;
24:41
even went on food stamps at one point to help us get by.
24:45
But she didn’t quit.
24:47
And she earned her degree,
24:49
and made sure that through scholarships and hard work,
24:51
my sister and I earned ours.
24:54
She used to wake me up when we were living overseas~
24:56
wake me up before dawn to study my English lessons.
24:59
And when I’d complain,
25:01
she’d just look at me and say,
25:02
“This is no picnic for me either,
25:03
buster.
25:06
” (Laughter.) And my mom ended up dedicating herself to helping women around the world access the money they needed to start their own businesses --she was an early pioneer in microfinance.
25:19
And that meant,
25:20
though,
25:21
that she was gone a lot,
25:22
and she had her own struggles
25:24
trying to figure out balancing
25:25
motherhood and a career.
25:27
And when she was gone,
25:31
my grandmother stepped up to take care of me.
25:31
She only had a high school education.
25:35
She got a job at a local bank.
25:37
She hit the glass ceiling,
25:38
and watched men she once trained
25:40
promoted up the ladder ahead of her.
25:42
But she didn’t quit.
25:45
Rather than grow hard or angry each time she got passed over,
25:49
she kept doing her job as best as she knew how,
25:51
and ultimately ended up being vice president at the bank.
25:56
She didn’t quit.
25:58
And later on,
26:00
I met a woman who was assigned
26:02
to advise me on my first summer job at a law firm.
26:04
And she gave me such good advice that I married her.
26:08
(Laughter.) And Michelle and I
26:11
gave everything we had to
26:12
balance our careers and a young family.
26:15
But let’s face it,
26:17
no matter how enlightened I must have thought myself to be,
26:21
it often fell more on her shoulders when I was traveling,
26:25
when I was away.
26:27
I know that when she was with our girls,
26:29
she’d feel guilty that she wasn’t giving enough time to her work,
26:32
and when she was at her work,
26:34
she’d feel guilty she wasn’t giving enough time to our girls.
26:37
And both of us wished we had some
26:38
superpower that would let us be in two places at once.
26:43
But we persisted.
26:45
We made that marriage work.
26:48
And the reason Michelle had the strength to juggle everything,
26:50
and put up with me and eventually the public spotlight,
26:53
was because she,
26:54
too,
26:55
came from a family of folks who didn’t quit~
26:57
because she saw her dad get up
26:58
and go to work every day even though
27:00
he never finished college,
27:02
even though he had crippling MS.
27:07
She saw her mother,
27:08
even though she never finished college,
27:11
in that school,
27:12
that urban school,
27:14
every day making sure Michelle
27:15
and her brother were getting the education they deserved.
27:19
Michelle saw how her parents never quit.
27:22
They never indulged in self-pity,
27:24
no matter how stacked the odds
27:26
were against them.
27:29
They didn’t quit.
27:34
Those are the folks who inspire me.
27:35
People ask me sometimes,
27:37
who inspires you, Mr. President?
27:38
Those quiet heroes all across this country
27:42
— some of your parents and grandparents
27:44
who are sitting here — no fanfare,
27:49
no articles written about them,
27:52
they just persevere.
27:54
They just do their jobs.
27:57
They meet their responsibilities.
28:00
They don’t quit.
28:04
I’m only here because of them.
28:07
They may not have set out to change the world,
28:09
but in small,
28:10
important ways,
28:11
they did.
28:13
They certainly changed mine.
28:16
So whether it’s starting a business,
28:17
or running for office,
28:19
or raising a amazing family,
28:24
remember that making your mark on the world is hard.
28:29
It takes patience.
28:31
It takes commitment.
28:34
It comes with plenty of setbacks and
28:35
it comes with plenty of failures.
28:39
But whenever you feel that creeping cynicism,
28:42
whenever you hear those voices say
28:44
you can’t make a difference,
28:46
whenever somebody tells you to set your sights lower
28:51
— the trajectory of this country should give you hope.
28:55
Previous generations should give you hope.
28:58
What young generations have done
28:59
before should give you hope.
29:02
Young folks who marched and mobilized
29:04
and stood up and sat in,
29:05
from Seneca Falls to Selma to Stonewall,
29:08
didn’t just do it for themselves; they did it for other people.
29:11
(Applause.)
29:13
That’s how we achieved women’s rights.
29:15
That’s how we achieved voting rights.
29:18
That’s how we achieved workers’ rights.
29:22
That’s how we achieved gay rights.
29:24
(Applause.) That’s how we’ve made
29:26
this Union more perfect.
29:29
(Applause.)
29:30
And if you’re willing to do your part now,
29:32
if you’re willing to reach up and close
29:34
that gap between what America is
29:35
and what America should be,
29:44
I want you to know that I will be right there with you.
29:46
(Applause.) If you are ready to fight for that brilliant,
29:48
radically simple idea of America
29:52
that no matter who you are or what you look like,
29:55
no matter who you love or what God you worship,
29:59
you can still pursue your own happiness,
30:03
I will join you every step of the way.
30:09
(Applause.) Now more than ever — now more than ever,

America needs what you,

has to offer.

America needs you to reach high and hope deeply.

And if you fight for your seat at the table,
30:26
and you set a better example,
30:28
and you persevere in what you decide to do with your life,
30:32
I have every faith not only that you will succeed,
30:35
but that,
30:35
through you,
30:37
our nation will continue to be a beacon of light for men and women,
30:41
boys and girls,

in every corner of the globe.

So thank you.
