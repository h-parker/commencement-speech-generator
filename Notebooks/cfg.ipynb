       "' John Hope Franklin  Chancellor Mullen, members of the board of regents, members of the board of trustees, faculty, students, friends of the university, members of the class of 2001, parents and loved ones. This is from this point of a view, a beautiful sight. The most magnificent umbrellas I think I ve ever seen, and I hope that you are comfortable under them. Despite the fact that some of the most cynical are the less sentimental among us, or plan denigrate commencement exercises, I for one, regard them as not only significant, but down right exciting. Anyone who s attended as many commencements as I have must have made peace with them in one way or another. I have made peace with them by falling in love with them. We in front of us these graduates, who have devoted years of arduous work in their courses of study, and the completion of their task is symbolized by the ritual of this commencement. Here are these relatives, and friends, who have given so much of themselves as a token of their esteem and confidence. And this commencement is quite special to them; for no one has more right then they do to have a sense of pride and joy. And here also are the officers and instructional staff of this great university, who season out and season in, day in and day out, they work so hard, and have done so much to make this a great educational experience for all of us. And finally, here are the friends and supporters of this University of North Carolina at Asheville, who through their generous support, have done so much to transform this place into a truly important center of learning. Each and every one of us, and each and every one of these groups is excited, and justly so, and each of them deserves a place of congratulations for us all. This ritual of commencement is important and very special for yet another reason. It is one more manifestation in our faith in the continuing importance of the entire educational enterprise. The history of higher education in both North Carolina and across the nation is, itself, an expression of faith in the value of education and indeed, its importance to all peoples regardless of color or other irrelevant circumstances. It is also a good thing that we pause from time to time, and recognize the role of education and indeed of public institutions, like this one, in the building and strengthening of this community and other communities as well. Despite what this institution attempts to do to assist in the education and secondary education, many of our school districts are little principalities walled off from each other, with no opportunity to share or pull resources such as personnel and facilities. They seem particularly hostile to students of a different class or of a different race or a different ethnic group. In the name of high principle of decentralization and neighborhood schools, every move to break down the barriers or establish programs of cooperation is met with stetted opposition. Consequently the few schools that are good, remain good, if somewhat isolated and sterile, while the many that are poor, remain poor. So let us pledge a new to use our wits as well as our resources, so that on their way to college, they will not find the going quite so difficult. Even with the bond issue that was successful when it was presented to the people of this state a few months ago, we cannot afford to sit back and relax as though we have won the ultimate victory. College facilities are still inadequate. College salaries are woefully inadequate. Many classrooms are overcrowded and equipment in our laboratories is far from being a state of the art. Yet, listen to our political leaders, who feel that their real value as statesmen is how eloquently, and in how many ways he or she can oppose increased revenue for our educational and other social purposes. Many of you who graduate today have had to pay dearly for your education. You have learned the value of an education, and you have reached definite conclusions about the importance of adequate and sound educational opportunities at every level. As you take stock of your educational experience, I hope that you will begin from this day forward, to define your own role in continuing in the task of improving our educational system so that your own children, and their children who follow, will not face the dilemmas and the difficulties that this generation has experienced. It is equally important that you make certain that excellent educational opportunities are equalized, not merely in terms of personnel and facilities, but also in terms of opportunities to learn about the social environment in which you and yours will live and work. It is as important to have excellent schools in the most disadvantageous areas of Asheville, as it is to have them in the areas of privilege. It is surely as important for the people who will inhabit such communities in the future to know that they were neither poor nor rich by divine right, and that the barriers or race, religion, and wealth are artificial and inconsequential as far as a true evaluation of a human being is concerned. I very much hope that every member of this graduating class will take time, regardless of how preoccupied you are with your own affairs, to become involved in the educational enterprise wherever you live. Much of the future of the next generation, indeed much of the future of our country, depends on what you do about education. We ve heard a great deal, perhaps enough, about accountability and about testing, and not nearly enough about caring and mentoring, and about content that we teach everyday.   I invite each and every one of you to join in the very important task of education our youth. There are all kinds of ways in which you can do this. You can help chose members of your school board who are imaginative, creative, and innovative in their vision of an educational system that places faith in our young people, but is also willing to take these young people by the hand, and help them navigate through the difficult shores of an educational system. And you can do even more. If you do not chose a career in teaching, and I hope that many of you will, you can still volunteer to help at the school near you. You can help in after school activities, and in the mentoring program. I have never heard of an oversupply of mentors, or teacher s aids, and the satisfaction that you will derive will be much more then you could expect. And let me give you an example of my own personal experience of this kind of volunteering. It happened many, many, years ago when I was twenty-years old. It happened many, many, years ago when I was twenty-years old. I was in my first month of graduate study in Harvard University. I was living in a rooming house where several other students lived, but there was also a middle-aged man whom I had seen, but not met. Late one afternoon, in my first month there, there was a light rap on my door. I opened it; the older man was standing there with a piece of paper in his hand. I invited him to come in, and he quickly came in the door, and he quickly told me what the point of his visit was. He said that he had received a letter that day, and some of the words were written in a way that made it difficult, or unclear, for him to understand, and he wondered if I could help him decipher these words. The minute I saw the letter I reached two conclusions. The first conclusion was that the man could not read, because the words were as clear as they could be, and the second was that the person who usually read his letters to him was unavailable, and he wanted someone to read the letter to him. So I simulated a kind of difficulty in deciphering while reading it, and when I finished reading the letter, and after the exchange of a few more words, I suggested to him that perhaps, with my help, he might drop by in the afternoon and perhaps we could read his letters together. Indeed, we could brush up on his reading in general. He protested that I would not have the time, I told him that I would take the time, and despite the fact that I had a full program of graduate classes, and was washing dishes at a club for my evening meal, and was typing term papers and dissertations to make ends meet, I was eager to teach that man to read. And so, in the next nine months, each weekday evening the man came to my room, and entered enthusiastically into the enterprise of learning to read, as I entered enthusiastically into the enterprise of learning to teach him how to read. And at the end of nine months, he could read simple sentences, especially ones that he was likely to receive in his letters. And at the end of the period, he took great pride in reading his letters to me. At the end of that period, I did not know it then, but I can now say in more then fifty-five years of teaching after I left graduate school, and after thousands of students, including thirty-two of my own PhDs, I would never again experience the satisfaction and the thrill of teaching, as I did when I was teaching that man how to read. So you who graduate today have enjoyed a rare privilege in achieving your own educational goals at UNC Asheville, it is a privilege that carries with it an awesome responsibility, that of doing everything you can, from this day forward, to create a community and a world where your children, and their children, and if you do they will be ever grateful, and we will give you the praise so which you deserve. And so my fellow classmates, it has been a high honor and a great privilege for me to be with you today and to participate in this ceremony. May you become activists in the promotion of the highest ideals of learning and service at the University of North Carolina at Asheville, and may your days ahead be filled with the light by which truth is revealed. And may you take with you, those ideals, as you assume your respective roles in life as you go down from this place. Congratulations, best wishes, and god speed. Thank you.  '"
