       "  'transcript': ' Thank you, Kent. I think after what     you heard you must be impressed. But I trust that you are smart enough     to know why I am invited to give your commencement. My office is only a     few meters from here and it will not cost     the Institute any travel     expenses, but the truth is that it\\'s only a lunch, free lunch     today, and I expect to get a raise with my salary.  Chairman Kresa,     Members of the Board of Trustees,      President Chameau,     Former Presidents      Baltimore and      Everhart,     Provost Stolper, Division Chairs, Faculty, Vice     Presidents, Staff, Distinguished Guests, and above all our Graduates: When President     Chameau asked me to give this year\\'s commencement address, I was in fact     delighted, and I am indeed honored to be here today with you, your     families, and our entire Caltech community. But what can one     say to the very bright graduates of Caltech that will be different     from what they already know? And if you are like my own children, you do     not really wish to have a lecture on what you should and should not do. So I decided     instead to share with you some personal experiences in the hope that     you may see why you are fortunate to reach this milestone, and to reflect     on what you can do with your fortune to forge a new future. I speak wearing     different hats. Like you, I have learned a great deal by being part of     the unique academic structure of Caltech. As a faculty member and     concerned citizen of the world, I have also acquired knowledge -- and     hopefully some wisdom -- about global affairs. And perhaps of special     importance to today\\'s celebration is that my own family, like yours, has     witnessed the joy of college graduation. Nearly twenty     years ago, I stood in this very stage and handed my own daughter a     Caltech science degree. My dear graduates, today you will receive a     degree, but soon you will discover that this special event is only a first     step on a long road. In fact, in many ways, today marks a new beginning     in your life. This rebirth is lauded in a commencement ceremony and the     tradition which dates back to the Middle Ages is a service in     celebration of and thanksgiving for lives dedicated to learning and     wisdom: learning you have     achieved by following the light of knowledge, and wisdom you have     acquired from experience and mentoring with love from your family, who     supported you throughout your journey. I take this     opportunity -- and I would like to take this opportunity to ask the     graduates to give a standing ovation to their own parents. Will you     please stand up and give your parents a standing ovation. Please sit down.     (And by the way, the last stimulus check from your parents will be cashed     today.) You are living in     a special age, the age of information, and you came to Caltech seeking     new knowledge. Information itself is not necessarily useful knowledge,     and both information and knowledge are not sufficient to synthesize     wisdom. One needs a proper education combined with experience -- and it     helps to have, of course, good genes, so try to choose your parents well. My message from     the outset is simple: always be guided by the light of knowledge and     wisdom to shape your future, the future of your country, and the future     of the world. When I came to the     United States in 1969, I was not dreaming of a      Nobel Prize (or a Pulitzer     prize), nor I was dreaming of acquiring a Bill Gates fortune. Armed with     the excellent education I received in Egypt, I was simply on a quest for     knowledge and a Ph.D. degree from a reputable institution in this land     of opportunity. Incidentally, my     English was so poor that at restaurants, I used to order \"deserts\" for     desserts. America was a     magnet for many members of my generation because of its leadership in     science and technology and its unique democratic values. The historic     landing of Neil Armstrong on the moon in 1969 was enough to demonstrate     America\\'s outlook on the new frontiers of knowledge. I was aware of     Edison\\'s dictum, \"Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine     percent perspiration,\" and I took advantage of being in the right place     at the right time -- of being in America and at Caltech. In fact, it was     Caltech\\'s ambiance and the country\\'s system of support that made it     possible for a young assistant professor to carry out, with his team,     research that in only ten years\\' time would      define a discipline that was     recognized by     the Nobel Prize in 1999. People often ask     me, How does one get a Nobel Prize, and what is the secret of success?     (And incidentally, the same people had no interest in asking this     question before I received the prize.) I believe it was passion for     science that supplied the energy and it was optimism that made the     almost-impossible, possible. My dear graduates,     success comes to the prepared mind. Success is not like rain that falls     from the sky equally upon everyone. Success is what you reap when you     sow with passion and optimism. Times have     changed. The world is more complex, and the America of today is not the     one I came to in 1969. We are now in the so-called \"global age\",     threatened by chemical, biological, and nuclear disasters,\\xa0 and the     United States faces real challenges: the rise of economic super-powers     such as China and India, the conflicts in the world overseas, and -- most     importantly, in my view -- the change in cultural, educational, and     political values. Yes, there are     challenges and changes, but you can still make your own success in your     own way because you are fortunate enough to have received an     exceptional education in a twenty-first century, developed-world     society. Your education is     unaffordable to at least eighty percent of the six billion people on the     planet who make merely a dollar a day. As importantly, America     continues to provide you with opportunities that even today you will not     find anywhere else in the world. And here, in this     country, you are free to speak and worship as you please, and you can     sleep at night without fear of the government or police. These     fundamental values are embedded in the foundation of this country, which     is built on pillars of life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.   Our world today is     full of opportunities, and you, the Caltech graduates, have a unique role     to play because of the special education you received in the sciences     and engineering and the rational thinking that this education has instilled     in you. Do not listen to     pessimists; rather, forge ahead to share your experience in whatever     field you are passionate about, which could be business, government,     law, art, or science. I do not know the future of business or politics,     but I know the future of science. Your generation     and the ones after yours will continue to seek a basic understanding of     nature and will make the many exciting discoveries that lie ahead -- from     the deciphering and control of the most fundamental constituents of     matter to discoveries at our universe\\'s boundaries, and to the unveiling     of our origin and the miracle of life. Your generation will also explore     other planets and possibly reach out to other galaxies. You now sit just a     few miles from JPL, where  Mars Science Laboratory rover is being built     for launch in November of this year. When the rover, named      Curiosity,     lands in August of next year, it will perform the first ever precision     landing on Mars and help us assess whether the planet can harbor life. Beyond these and     other intellectual achievements, there are direct benefits to peoples\\'     liberty. From early in history, the quest of knowledge has been a driving     force of revolutionary change, not only causing paradigm shifts in our     understanding of the cosmos but also acting as an agent for the     naissance     and renaissance of human societies. The      European     Renaissance would have been impossible without enlightenment about the     significance of knowledge and the rational thinking. I think too much     credit is given to the impact of politics on the progress of society.     Without science there is no development, and politicians would be unable     to promise prosperity. Just think: What     would our world be like without electricity, penicillin, and the     airplane? From the agriculture and industrial revolutions to today\\'s     genomics and IT revolutions, science is at center stage for societal     advancement, and Caltech graduates will surely play a leading role in     conquering the next frontiers of discovery, innovations, and progress. Even in politics,     technology is becoming the new weapon for transformative change in     society. The youth of your generation are now harnessing information     technology to do what those of my generation thought impossible. Elsewhere in the     world, there still exists oppression, occupation, and human suffering; and young people are revolting to acquire liberty from repressive     regimes. The hope I witnessed first hand in Egypt is a telling     indication of a new role for science in democracy. You are aware, no     doubt, of the peoples\\' revolution sweeping the Middle East as I     speak. I witnessed in real time the      Egyptian uprising that began on     January 25th of this year, and, remarkably, led to the removal of Mr.     Mubarak in only eighteen days. I saw university     students in the hundreds of thousands, and then people in [the] millions,     marching toward      Tahrir Square in Cairo. The name of the square means     \"liberty\", and that is precisely what the youth wanted from a thirty-year-old regime. They demonstrated peacefully, with impeccable organizational     skills and in unison. In my generation,     we would probably have had to use stones, sticks, and guns in order to     rise up; in your generation, they used Facebook, Twitter, and SMS.     Without the development of the chip, wireless technology, and the     Internet, this revolution may never have succeeded as a peaceful and     civilized transformation. Although the road     ahead is bumpy, I am optimistic that with investment in education and     development, again through science, a democratic Egypt will emerge. You     may be interested to know that only a few months after the revolution,     Egypt announced -- announced the establishment of a      New City for Science     and Technology on three hundred acres of land, and guess which     university model will be followed -- your soon to be alma mater, Caltech\\'s! When people in the     Middle East ultimately gain their freedom, the world will be better off.     Some scholars argue that the world is destined always to be embroiled in     conflicts and wars. But this bleak picture is surely not the result of a     natural phenomenon. We the people     cause such conflicts, and we the people can either kindle the fire or     help to extinguish it. The United States cannot change the culture of     other people, and nations are responsible for their own plights, but it is     the  kismet of the United States to lead in the world by utilizing its most     valuable force: the American value system of individual liberty,     justice, and human rights. I believe that     much can be achieved not by hegemony but by the strategic use of the     real force of America -- its      soft power. The soft power of science has     the     potential to reshape global diplomacy -- and at significantly lower     expense than that needed for use of the hard power of military     involvement. I am hopeful that     a new national policy will be charted for leadership in innovation.     This policy should be inclusive of international science diplomacy for     partnerships in development. Some may argue that it is naïve to think of     applying such idealistic values in our imperfect world, but directing     the influence of science diplomacy is in the best interests of the     United States. Through the power     of knowledge, we can efface ignorance and shape a future that binds     cultures and civilizations. In     his recent Cairo speech, President     Barack Obama articulated a new initiative for cooperation and     partnership that emphasizes the role of science and diplomacy,     particularly with the Muslim-majority countries. Earlier, the     President appointed me to his      Council of Advisors on Science and     Technology, and later      I became U.S. Science Envoy to the Middle East. I     embarked on a diplomatic mission that took me back to where I came from,     but now with a different objective. From touring and seeing the state of     science and education, not only in the region, but also globally, I     believe we will face serious consequences if we do not choose to act. I recently read an     important study that left me awestruck by the demographics of knowledge     across our planet\\'s population. In  [Educating     All Children]: A Global Agenda,     Joel Cohen and David Bloom argue that the aim of achieving primary and     secondary schooling for all the children is urgent and feasible, and yet     more than three hundred million children will not be in school in the     year [2015]. Every effort     should be made to change this state of affairs so that we may hope for     a better future for our world.  So, the twenty-first century education     that you are fortunate to have received at Caltech is far-reaching. It     reaches beyond the classical boundaries -- not just across so-called     interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary fields, but also between nations     and maybe soon even across planets. Perhaps the best     words to describe the value of education and knowledge are those of     Thomas Jefferson. In 1782 in his Notes on Virginia, he wrote:      The general objects [of a bill to diffuse knowledge more generally      through the mass of people] are to provide them education adapted to      the years, to the capacity, and the condition of everyone and      directed to their freedom and happiness.1 Remarkably,     Jefferson, more than two centuries ago, saw the virtue of education on     the individual and global level. My dear graduates,     this commencement is the initial stage of a developmental process. It is     a beginning of a long voyage. In this journey, invest your fortune of     knowledge wisely and forge your place and time into opportunity. Have a     dream and work hard to realize that dream as did the great man who spoke     these resounding words, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.:      Without hard work, we are not entitled to a good life -- and without      compassion, we will not attain the good life in a world-majority      population of have-nots.'},\n",

       "  'transcript': '\\xa0[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from  audio English translation]I am sincerely happy to be here on the   occasion of the 327th commencement of this old and most prestigious university. My   congratulations and very best wishes to all of today\\'s graduates.Harvard\\'s motto is \"VERITAS.\" Many of you have   already found out, and others will find out in the course of their lives, that   truth eludes us if we do not concentrate our attention totally on it\\'s pursuit.   But even while it eludes us, the illusion of knowing it still lingers and leads   to many misunderstandings. Also, truth seldom is pleasant; it is almost invariably bitter.   There is some bitterness in my today\\'s speech too, but I want to stress that it   comes not from an adversary, but from a friend.Three years ago in the United States I said   certain things which at that time appeared unacceptable. Today, however,   many people agree with what I then said.The split in today\\'s world is perceptible even to   a hasty glance. Any of our contemporaries readily identifies two world powers,   each of them already capable of entirely destroying the other. However,    understanding of the split often is limited to this political conception:   that danger may be abolished through successful   diplomatic negotiations or by achieving a balance of armed forces. The truth is   that the split is a much [more] profound [one] and a more alienating one, that the rifts are   more than one can see at first glance. This deep manifold split bears   the danger of manifold disaster for all of us, in accordance with the   ancient truth that a kingdom -- in this case, our Earth -- divided against itself   cannot stand.There is the concept of   \"Third World\": thus, we   already have three worlds. Undoubtedly, however, the number is even greater; we   are just too far away to see. Any ancient and deeply rooted, autonomous   culture, especially if it is spread on a wide part of the earth\\'s surface,   constitutes an autonomous world, full of riddles and surprises to Western   thinking. As a minimum, we must include in this category China, India, the Muslim world,   and Africa, if indeed we accept the approximation of viewing the latter two as   compact units.For one thousand years Russia belonged to such a   category, although Western thinking systematically committed the mistake of   denying its autonomous character and therefore never understood it, just as today   the West does not understand Russia in Communist captivity. It may be   that in past years Japan has increasingly become a distant part of the West. I   am no judge here. But as to Israel, for instance, it seems to me that it\\'s been   the part from the western world, in that its state system is fundamentally linked to religion.How short a time ago, relatively, the small,   new European world was easily seizing colonies everywhere, not only   without anticipating any real resistance, but also usually despising any   possible values in the conquered people\\'s approach to life. On the face of it,   it was an   overwhelming success. There were no geographic frontiers [limits] to it. Western society expanded in a   triumph of human independence and power. And all of a sudden in the 20th   century came the discovery of its fragility and friability. We now see that the conquests proved to be short   lived and precarious -- and this, in turn, points to defects in the Western view   of the world which led to these conquests. Relations with the former colonial   world now have turned into their opposite and the Western world often   goes to extremes of subservience, but it is difficult yet to estimate the   total size of the bill which former colonial countries will present to the West and it   is difficult to predict whether the surrender not only of its last colonies, but   of everything it owns, will be sufficient for the West to foot the bill.But the blindness of superiority   continues in spite of all and upholds the belief that the vast regions   everywhere on our planet should   develop and mature to the level of present day Western systems, which in theory   are the best and in practice the most attractive. There is this belief that all those other worlds are   only being   temporarily prevented (by wicked governments or by heavy crises or by their own   barbarity and incomprehension) from taking the way of Western pluralistic democracy and   from adopting the Western way of life. Countries are judged on the merit of their   progress in this direction.However, it is a conception which develops out   of Western incomprehension of the essence of other worlds,   out of the mistake of measuring   them all with a Western yardstick. The real picture of our planet\\'s development   is quite different and which about our divided world gave birth to the   theory of convergence between leading Western countries and the Soviet   Union. It is a soothing theory which overlooks the fact that these worlds are   not at all developing into similarity. Neither one can be transformed into the   other without the use of violence. Besides, convergence inevitably means acceptance of the   other side\\'s defects, too, and this is hardly desirable.If I were today addressing an audience in my   country, examining the overall pattern of the world\\'s rifts, I would   have concentrated on the East\\'s calamities. But since my forced exile in   the West has now lasted four years and since my audience is a Western one, I   think it may be of greater interest to concentrate on certain aspects of the   West, in our days, such as I see them.A decline in courage may be the most striking   feature which an outside observer notices in the West in our days. The Western world   has lost its civil courage, both as a whole and separately, in each country,    each government, each political party, and, of course, in the United Nations.   Such a decline in courage is particularly noticeable among the ruling groups and   the intellectual elite, causing an impression of loss of courage by the entire   society. Of course, there are many courageous individuals, but they have no determining   influence on public life.Political and intellectual bureaucrats show depression, passivity, and perplexity in their actions and in their   statements, and even more so in theoretical reflections to explain how   realistic, reasonable, as well as intellectually and even morally worn it is to   base state policies on weakness and cowardice. And decline in courage is   ironically emphasized by occasional explosions of anger and inflexibility on the part of the same   bureaucrats when dealing with weak governments and with countries not supported   by anyone, or with currents which cannot offer any resistance. But they   get tongue-tied and paralyzed when they deal with powerful governments and   threatening forces, with aggressors and international terrorists.Should one point out that from ancient times   declining courage has been considered the beginning of the end?When the modern Western states were created,   the principle was proclaimed that governments are meant to serve man and man lives to be free and   to pursue happiness. See, for example, the   American Declaration of Independence. Now, at last, during past decades technical   and social progress has permitted the realization of such aspirations: the   welfare state.Every citizen has been granted the desired   freedom and material goods in such quantity and of such quality as to guarantee   in theory the achievement of happiness -- in the morally inferior sense of the   word which has come into being during those same decades. In the process,   however, one psychological detail has been overlooked: the constant desire to   have still more things and a still better life and the struggle to attain them imprint many Western   faces with worry and even depression, though it is customary to conceal such feelings.   Active and tense competition fills all   human thoughts without opening a way to free spiritual development.The individual\\'s independence from many types of   state pressure has been guaranteed. The majority of people have been granted   well-being to an extent their fathers and grandfathers could not even dream   about. It has become possible to raise young people according to these ideals,   leaving them to physical splendor, happiness, possession of material goods, money, and leisure, to an almost   unlimited freedom of enjoyment. So who should now renounce all   this? Why? And for what should one risk one\\'s precious life in   defense of common values and particularly in such nebulous cases when the   security of one\\'s nation must be defended in a distant country? Even biology   knows that habitual, extreme safety and well-being are not advantageous for a living organism. Today, well-being   in the life of Western society has begun to reveal its pernicious mask.Western society has given itself the   organization best suited to its purposes based, I would say, one the letter of   the law. The   limits of human rights and righteousness are determined by a system of laws; such   limits are very broad. People in the West have acquired considerable skill in   interpreting and manipulating law. Any conflict is solved according to the   letter of the law and this is considered to be the supreme solution. If one is   right from a legal point of view, nothing more is required. Nobody will mention that one could still not be   entirely right,   and urge self-restraint, a willingness to renounce such legal rights, sacrifice   and selfless risk. It would sound simply absurd. One almost never sees voluntary self-restraint.   Everybody operates at the extreme   limit of those legal frames.I have spent all my life under a Communist regime   and I will tell you that a society without any objective legal scale is a   terrible one indeed. But a society with no other scale than the legal one is not   quite worthy of man either. A society which is based on the letter of the law   and never reaches any higher is taking very scarce advantage of the high level   of human possibilities. The letter of the law is too cold and formal to have a beneficial   influence on society. Whenever the tissue of life is woven of legalistic   relations, there is an atmosphere of moral mediocrity, paralyzing   man\\'s noblest impulses. And it will be simply impossible to stand through   the trials of this threatening century with only the support of a   legalistic structure.In today\\'s Western society the   inequality has been revealed [in] freedom for good deeds and freedom for evil deeds. A   statesman who wants to achieve something important and highly constructive for his country has   to move cautiously and even timidly. There are thousands of hasty and irresponsible   critics around him; parliament and the press keep rebuffing him. As he moves   ahead, he has to prove that each single step of his is well-founded and absolutely   flawless. Actually, an outstanding and particularly gifted person who has unusual and   unexpected initiatives in mind hardly gets a chance to assert himself. From the   very beginning, dozens   of traps will be set out for him. Thus, mediocrity triumphs with the excuse of   restrictions imposed by democracy.It is feasible and easy everywhere to undermine   administrative power and in fact it has been drastically weakened in all Western   countries. The defense of individual rights has reached such extremes as to make   society as a whole defenseless against certain individuals. It\\'s time, in the   West -- It is time, in the West, to defend not so much human rights as human obligations.Destructive and irresponsible   freedom has been granted boundless space. Society appears to have little   defense against the abyss of human decadence, such as, for example, misuse of   liberty for moral violence against young people, such as motion pictures full of   pornography, crime, and horror. It is considered to be part of freedom and   theoretically counterbalanced by the young people\\'s right not to look or   not to accept. Life organized legalistically has thus shown its inability to   defend itself against the corrosion of evil.And what shall we say criminality as such? Legal   frames, especially in the United States, are broad   enough to encourage not only individual freedom but also certain individual   crimes. The culprit can go unpunished or obtain undeserved leniency with   the support of thousands of public defenders. When a government   starts an earnest fight against terrorism, public opinion immediately accuses   it of violating the terrorist\\'s civil rights. There are many such   cases.Such a tilt of freedom in the direction of evil   has come about   gradually, but it was evidently born primarily out of a humanistic and benevolent concept   according to which there is no evil inherent to human nature. The world belongs   to mankind and all the defects of life are caused by wrong social systems,   which must be corrected. Strangely enough, though the best social   conditions have been achieved in the West, there still is criminality and there   even is considerably more of it than in the pauper and lawless   Soviet society.The press too, of course, enjoys the widest   freedom. (I shall be using the word press to include all media.) But what sort   of use does it make of this freedom?Here again, the main concern is not to infringe   the letter of the law. There is no true moral responsibility for deformation or   disproportion. What sort of responsibility does a journalist or a newspaper have   to his readers, or to his history -- or to history? If they have misled public   opinion or the government by inaccurate information or wrong conclusions, do we   know of any cases of public recognition and rectification of such mistakes by   the same journalist or the same newspaper? It hardly ever happens because it   would damage sales. A nation may be the victim of such a mistake, but the   journalist usually always gets away with it. One may -- One may safely assume   that he will start writing the opposite with renewed self-assurance.Because instant and credible information has to   be given, it becomes necessary to resort to guesswork, rumors, and suppositions   to fill in the voids, and none -- and none of them will ever be rectified; they will stay on   in the readers\\' memories. How many hasty, immature, superficial, and misleading   judgments are expressed every day, confusing readers, without any verification.   The press -- The press can both simulate public opinion and miseducate it. Thus, we may see   terrorists described as heroes, or secret matters\\xa0 pertaining to one\\'s nation\\'s defense   publicly revealed, or we may witness shameless intrusion on the privacy of   well-known people under the slogan: \"Everyone is entitled to know everything.\"   But this is a false slogan, characteristic of a false era. People also have the   right not to know and it\\'s a much more valuable one. The right not to have   their divine souls [stuffed with gossip, nonsense, vain talk.] A person who works   and leads a meaningful life does not need this excessive burdening flow of   information.Hastiness and superficiality are the psychic   disease of the 20th century and more than anywhere else this disease is   reflected in the press. Such as it is, however, the press has become the   greatest power within the Western countries, more powerful than the legislative   power,   the executive, and the judiciary. And one would then like to ask: By what law has it   been elected and to whom is it responsible? In the communist East a journalist   is frankly appointed as a state official. But who has granted Western   journalists their power, for how long a time, and with what prerogatives?There is yet another surprise for someone coming   from the East, where the press is rigorously unified. One gradually discovers a   common trend of preferences within the Western press as a whole. It is a   fashion; there are generally accepted patterns of judgment; there may be   common corporate interests, the sum effect being not competition but   unification. Enormous freedom exists for the press, but not for the readership   because newspaper[s] mostly develop stress and emphasis to those opinions   which do not too openly contradict their own and the general trend.Without any censorship, in the West fashionable   trends of thought and ideas are carefully separated from those which are not   fashionable; nothing is forbidden, but what is not fashionable will hardly ever   find its way into periodicals or books or be heard in colleges. Legally your   researchers are free, but they are conditioned by the fashion of the day. There   is no open violence such as in the East; however, a selection dictated by   fashion and the need to match mass standards frequently prevent   independent-minded people giving their contribution to public life. There   is a dangerous tendency to flock together and shut off successful development. I   have received letters in America from highly intelligent persons, maybe a   teacher in a faraway small college who could do much for the renewal and   salvation of his country, but his country cannot hear him because the media are   not interested in him. This gives birth to strong mass prejudices, to blindness,   which is most dangerous in our dynamic era. There is, for instance, a   self-deluding interpretation of the contemporary world situation. It works as a   sort of a petrified armor around people\\'s minds. Human voices from 17 countries of   Eastern Europe and Eastern Asia cannot pierce it. It will only be broken by the   pitiless crowbar of events.I have mentioned a few traits of Western life   which surprise and shock a new arrival to this world. The purpose and scope of   this speech will not allow me to continue such a review, to look into the   influence of these Western characteristics on important aspects of a   nation\\'s life, such as elementary education, advanced education in the   humanities and art.It is almost   universally recognized that the West shows all the world a way to successful   economic development, even though in the past years it has been strongly   disturbed by chaotic inflation. However, many people living in the West are   dissatisfied with their own society. They despise it or accuse it of not being   up to the level of maturity attained by mankind. A number of such critics turn   to socialism, which is a false and dangerous current.I hope that no one present will suspect me of   offering my personal criticism of the Western system to present socialism as an   alternative. Having experienced -- Having experienced applied socialism in a country where the   alternative has been realized, I certainly will not speak for it. The well-known   Soviet mathematician  Shafarevich, a member of the Soviet Academy of Science, has   written a brilliant book under the title   Socialism; it is a profound   analysis showing that socialism of any type and shade leads to a total   destruction of the human spirit and to a leveling of mankind into death.   Shafarevich\\'s book was published in France -- Shafarevich\\'s book was published in France almost two years ago and so far no   one has been found to refute it. It will shortly be published in the   United States.But should someone ask me whether I would   indicate the West such as it is today as a model to my country, frankly I would   have to answer negatively. No, I could not recommend your society in its present   state as an ideal for the transformation of ours. Through intense suffering our   country has now achieved a spiritual development of such intensity that the   Western system in its present state of spiritual exhaustion does not look   attractive. Even those characteristics of your life which I have just mentioned   are extremely saddening.A fact which cannot be disputed is the weakening   of human beings in the West while in the East they are becoming firmer and   stronger -- 60 years for our people and 30 years for the people of Eastern   Europe. During that time we have been through a spiritual training far in   advance of Western experience. Life\\'s complexity and mortal weight have produced   stronger, deeper, and more interesting characters than those generally   [produced] by   standardized Western well-being.Therefore, if our society were to be transformed   into yours, it would mean an improvement in certain aspects, but also a change   for the worse on some particularly significant scores. It is true, no doubt,   that a society cannot remain in an abyss of lawlessness, as is the case in our   country. But it is also demeaning for it to elect such mechanical legalistic   smoothness as you have. After the suffering of many years of violence and   oppression, the human soul longs for things higher, warmer, and purer than those   offered by today\\'s mass living habits, introduced by the revolting invasion of   publicity, by TV stupor, and by intolerable music.There are meaningful warnings which history gives   a threatened or perishing society. Such are, for instance, the decadence of art,   or a lack of great statesmen. There are open and evident warnings, too. The   center of your democracy and of your culture is left without electric power for   a few hours only, and all of a sudden crowds of American citizens start looting   and creating havoc. The smooth surface film must be very thin, then, the social   system quite unstable and unhealthy.But the fight for our planet, physical and   spiritual, a fight of cosmic proportions, is not a vague matter of the future;   it has already started. The forces of Evil have begun their offensive;   you can feel their pressure, and yet your screens and publications are full of   prescribed smiles and raised glasses. What is the joy about?Very well known representatives of your society,   such as George Kennan, say: We cannot apply moral criteria to politics. Thus, we   mix good and evil, right and wrong, and make space for the absolute triumph of   absolute Evil in the world. On the contrary, only moral criteria can help the   West against communism\\'s well planned world strategy. There are no other   criteria. Practical or occasional considerations of any kind will inevitably be   swept away by strategy. After a certain level of the problem has been reached,   legalistic thinking induces paralysis; it prevents one from seeing the size and   meaning of events.In spite of the abundance of information, or   maybe because of it, the West has difficulties in understanding reality such as   it is. There have been naive predictions by some American experts who believed   that Angola would become the Soviet Union\\'s Vietnam or that Cuban expeditions in   Africa would best be stopped by special U.S. courtesy to Cuba. Kennan\\'s advice   to his own country -- to begin unilateral disarmament -- belongs to the same   category. If you only knew how the youngest of the Kremlin officials laugh at your political wizards. As to Fidel Castro, he frankly scorns   the United States, sending his troops to distant adventures from his country   right next to yours.However, the most cruel mistake occurred with the   failure to understand the Vietnam war. Some people sincerely wanted all wars to   stop just as soon as possible; others believed that there should be room for   national, or communist, self-determination in Vietnam, or in Cambodia, as we see   today with particular clarity. But members of the U.S. anti-war movement wound   up being involved in the betrayal of Far Eastern nations, in a genocide and in   the suffering today imposed on 30 million people there. Do those convinced   pacifists hear the moans coming from there? Do they understand their   responsibility today? Or do they prefer not to hear?The American Intelligentsia   lost its nerve and as a consequence thereof danger has come much closer to the   United States. But there is no awareness of this. Your shortsighted politicians   who signed the hasty Vietnam capitulation seemingly gave America a carefree   breathing pause; however, a hundredfold Vietnam now looms over you. That small   Vietnam had been a warning and an occasion to mobilize the nation\\'s courage. But   if a full-fledged America suffered a real defeat from a small communist   half-country, how can the West hope to stand firm in the future?I have had occasion already to say that in the   20th century Western democracy has not won any major war without help and protection   from a powerful continental ally whose philosophy and ideology it did not   question. In World War II against Hitler, instead of winning that war with its   own forces, which would certainly have been sufficient, Western democracy grew   and cultivated another enemy who would prove worse, as   Hitler never had so many resources and so many people, nor did he offer any   attractive ideas, or have a large number of supporters in the West as the Soviet Union. At present, some Western voices   already have spoken of obtaining protection from a third power against   aggression in the next world conflict, if there is one. In this case the shield   would be China. But I would not wish such an outcome to any country in the   world. First of all, it is again a doomed alliance with Evil; also, it would   grant the United States a respite, but when at a later date China with its   billion people would turn around armed with American weapons, America itself   would fall prey to a genocide similar to the in Cambodia in our   days.And yet -- no weapons, no matter how powerful,   can help the West until it overcomes its loss of willpower. In a state of   psychological weakness, weapons become a burden for the capitulating side. To   defend oneself, one must also be ready to die; there is little such readiness in   a society raised in the cult of material well-being. Nothing is left, then, but   concessions, attempts to gain time, and betrayal. Thus at the shameful Belgrade   conference free Western diplomats in their weakness surrendered the line where   enslaved members of Helsinki Watchgroups are sacrificing their lives.Western thinking has become conservative: the   world situation should stay as it is at any cost; there should be no changes.   This debilitating dream of a status quo is the symptom of a society which has   come to the end of its development. But one must be blind in order not to see   that oceans no longer belong to the West, while land under its domination keeps   shrinking. The two so-called world wars (they were by far not on a world scale,   not yet) have meant internal self-destruction of the small, progressive West   which has thus prepared its own end. The next war (which does not have to be an   atomic one and I do not believe it will) may well bury Western civilization   forever. Facing such a danger, with such splendid historical values   in your past, at such a high level of realization of freedom and of   devotion to freedom, how is it possible to lose to such an extent the will to   defend oneself?How has this unfavorable relation of forces come   about? How did the West decline from its triumphal march to its present   sickness? Have there been fatal turns and losses of direction in its   development? It does not seem so. The West kept advancing socially in accordance   with its proclaimed intentions, with the help of brilliant technological   progress. And all of a sudden it found itself in its present state of weakness.This means that the mistake must be at the root,   at the very basis of human thinking in the past centuries. I refer to the   prevailing Western view of the world which was first born during the Renaissance   and found its political expression from the period of the Enlightenment. It   became the basis for government and social science and could be defined as   rationalistic humanism or humanistic autonomy: the proclaimed and enforced   autonomy of man from any higher force above him. It could also be called   anthropocentricity, with man seen as the center of everything that exists.The turn introduced by the Renaissance evidently   was inevitable historically. The Middle Ages had come to a natural end by   exhaustion, becoming an intolerable despotic repression of man\\'s physical nature   in favor of the spiritual one. Then, however, we turned our backs upon the   Spirit and embraced all that is material with excessive and unwarranted zeal.   This new way of thinking, which had imposed on us its guidance, did not admit   the existence of intrinsic evil in man nor did it see any higher task than the   attainment of happiness on earth. It based modern Western civilization on the   dangerous trend to worship man and his material needs. Everything beyond   physical well-being and accumulation of material goods, all other human   requirements and characteristics of a subtler and higher nature, were left   outside the area of attention of state and social systems, as if human life did   not have any superior sense. That provided access for evil, of which in our days   there is a free and constant flow. Merely freedom does not in the least solve   all the problems of human life and it even adds a number of new ones.However, in early democracies, as in the American   democracy at the time of its birth, all individual human rights were granted   because man is God\\'s creature. That is, freedom was given to the individual   conditionally, in the assumption of his constant religious responsibility. Such   was the heritage of the preceding thousand years. Two hundred or even fifty   years ago, it would have seemed quite impossible, in America, that an individual   could be granted boundless freedom simply for the satisfaction of his instincts   or whims. Subsequently, however, all such limitations were discarded everywhere   in the West; a total liberation occurred from the moral heritage of Christian   centuries with their great reserves of mercy and sacrifice. State systems were   -- State systems were becoming increasingly and totally materialistic. The West ended up by truly   enforcing human rights, sometimes even excessively, but man\\'s sense of   responsibility to God and society grew dimmer and dimmer. In the past decades,   the legalistically selfish aspect of Western approach and thinking has reached   its final dimension and the world wound up in a harsh spiritual crisis and a   political impasse. All the glorified technological achievements of Progress,   including the conquest of outer space, do not redeem the 20th century\\'s   moral poverty which no one could imagine even as late as in the 19th   Century.As humanism in its development became more and   more materialistic, it made itself increasingly accessible to speculation and   manipulation by socialism and then by communism. So that Karl Marx was   able to say that \"communism is naturalized humanism.\"This statement turned out not to be entirely   senseless. One does see the same stones in the foundations of a despiritualized   humanism and of any type of socialism: endless materialism; freedom from   religion and religious responsibility, which under communist regimes reach the   stage of anti-religious dictatorships; concentration on social structures with a   seemingly scientific approach. This is typical of the Enlightenment in the 18th Century and of Marxism. Not by coincidence all of communism\\'s   meaningless pledges and oaths are about Man, with a capital M, and his earthly   happiness. At first glance it seems an ugly parallel: common traits in the   thinking and way of life of today\\'s West and today\\'s East? But such is the logic   of materialistic development.The interrelationship is such, too, that the   current of materialism which is most to the left always ends up by being   stronger, more attractive, and victorious, because it is more consistent.   Humanism without its Christian heritage cannot resist such competition. We watch   this process in the past centuries and especially in the past decades, on a   world scale as the situation becomes increasingly dramatic. Liberalism was   inevitably displaced by radicalism; radicalism had to surrender to socialism;   and   socialism could never resist communism. The communist regime in the East could   stand and grow due to the enthusiastic support from an enormous number of   Western intellectuals who felt a kinship and refused to see communism\\'s crimes.   And when they no longer could do so, they tried to justify them. In our Eastern   countries, communism has suffered a complete ideological defeat; it is zero and   less than zero. But Western intellectuals still look at it with interest and   with empathy, and this is precisely what makes it so immensely difficult for the   West to withstand the East.I am not examining here the case of a world war   disaster and the changes which it would produce in society. As long as we wake   up every morning under a peaceful sun, we have to lead an everyday life. There   is a disaster, however, which has already been under way for quite some time. I   am referring to the calamity of a despiritualized and irreligious humanistic   consciousness.To such consciousness, man is the touchstone in   judging everything on earth -- imperfect man, who is never free of   pride, self-interest, envy, vanity, and dozens of other defects. We are now   experiencing the consequences of mistakes which had not been noticed at the   beginning of the journey. On the way from the Renaissance to our days we have   enriched our experience, but we have lost the concept of a Supreme Complete   Entity which used to restrain our passions and our irresponsibility. We have   placed too much hope in political and social reforms, only to find out that we   were being deprived of our most precious possession: our spiritual life. In the   East, it is destroyed by the dealings and machinations of the ruling party. In   the West, commercial interests suffocate it. This is the real crisis.   The split in the world is less terrible -- The split in the world is less   terrible than the similarity of the disease   plaguing its main sections.If humanism were right in declaring that man is   born only to be happy, he would not be born to die. Since his body is doomed to die,   his task on earth evidently must be of a more spiritual nature. It cannot   be unrestrained enjoyment of everyday life. It cannot be the search for the best   ways to obtain material goods and then cheerfully get the most of them. It   has to be the fulfillment of a permanent, earnest duty so that one\\'s life   journey may become an experience of moral growth, so that one may leave life a   better human being than one started it. It is imperative to review the table of   widespread human values. Its present incorrectness is astounding. It is not   possible that assessment of the President\\'s performance be reduced to the   question how much money one makes or of unlimited availability of gasoline.   Only voluntary, inspired self-restraint can raise man above the world stream of   materialism.It would be retrogression to attach oneself today   to the ossified formulas of the Enlightenment. Social dogmatism leaves us   completely helpless in front of the trials of our times. Even if we are spared destruction by war, our   lives will have to change if we want to save life from self-destruction. We   cannot avoid revising the fundamental definitions of human life and human   society. Is it true that man is above everything? Is there no Superior Spirit   above him? Is it right that man\\'s life and society\\'s activities have to be   determined by material expansion in the first place? Is it permissible to   promote such expansion to the detriment of our spiritual integrity?If the world has not come to its end, it has   approached a major turn in history, equal in importance to the turn from the   Middle Ages to the Renaissance. It will exact from us a spiritual upsurge: We   shall have to rise to a new height of vision, to a new level of life where our   physical nature will not be cursed as in the Middle Ages, but, even more   importantly, our spiritual being will not be trampled upon as in the Modern era.This ascension will be similar to climbing onto   the next anthropologic stage. No one on earth has any other way left but --   upward.     Book/CDs by Michael E.

President     Bacow, Fellows of the Corporation, Members of the Board of Overseers,     Members of the Alumni Board, Members of the Faculty, Proud Parents, and     Graduates:     Today is a day of joy. It\\'s your day. Many congratulations. I am     delighted to be here today and would like to tell you about some of my     own experiences. This ceremony marks the end of an intensive and,     probably also, hard chapter in your lives. Now the door to a new life is     opening. That\\'s exciting and inspiring.     The German writer  Hermann Hesse had some wonderful words     for such a situation in life. I\\'d like to quote him and then continue in     my native language. Hermann Hesse     wrote:    In all beginnings dwells a magic force      For guarding us and helping us     to live.1       These words by Hermann Hesse inspired me when I completed my physics     degree at the age of 24. That was back in the year 1978.      The world was divided into     East and West. It was during of the Cold War. I grew up in East     Germany, in the GDR, at a time when that part of my homeland was not     free, in a     dictatorship. People were oppressed and monitored by the state. Political opponents     were persecuted. The government of the GDR was afraid that the people     would run away to freedom. And that\\'s why the Berlin Wall was built. It     was made of concrete and steel. Anyone who was discovered trying to     overcome it was arrested or shot. This wall in the middle of Berlin     divided a people -- and it divided families. My family was divided too.     My first job after graduation was as a physicist in East Berlin at the      Academy of Sciences. I lived near the Berlin Wall. On the way home from     my institute I walked past it every day. Behind it lay West Berlin,     freedom. And every day, when I was very close to the wall, I had to turn     away at the last moment -- and head towards my apartment. Every day I had to turn     away from freedom at the last minute. I don\\'t know how many times I thought, I     couldn\\'t stand it anymore. It     was really frustrating.     I was not a dissident. I did not run up and bang against the wall, but     neither did I     deny its existence because I did not want to lie to myself. The Berlin Wall limited     my possibilities. It was literally in my way. But one thing that this     wall could not do in all these years: It could not impose limits on my own inner     thoughts.     My personality, my imagination, my yearnings -- these could not be     limited by prohibitions and coercion.     Then came      the year 1989. Throughout Europe, the shared will     for freedom     unleashed incredible powers. Hundreds of thousands took to the streets     in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and the GDR. The people demonstrated     and brought down the wall. What many people had not thought possible --     even me -- became reality. Where once there had been a dark wall, a door     suddenly opened. The moment had come for me, too, to step through that     door. I did     not have to turn away from freedom at the last minute any longer. I could cross that     line and venture out into the great, wide open.     During these months, 30 years ago, I personally experienced that     nothing has to remain as it is. This experience, dear graduates, is the     first thought I would like to share with you today for your future: What seems fixed     and unchanging can in fact change.     And in matters both large and small, every change begins in the mind. The     generation of my parents had to learn this most painfully. My father and     mother were born in 1926 and 1928. When they were as old as most of you     here today, the rupture of civilization that was the Shoa [Holocaust] and the Second World War     had just ended. My country, Germany, had brought unimaginable suffering     upon     Europe and the world. How likely would it have been for the victors and     the vanquished to remain irreconcilable for many years? But instead, Europe     overcame centuries of conflict. The result was a peaceful order based on     common values rather than supposed national strength.     Notwithstanding all the discussions     and temporary setbacks, I am firmly convinced that we Europeans have     united for the better. And the relationship between Germans and Americans shows how former     enemies in war can become friends.     It was George Marshall who gave a significant contribution to this with     the plan  which he proclaimed in this very place at a     Commencement Address in 1947. The transatlantic partnership with our values of     democracy and human rights has given us a time of peace and prosperity     to the benefit of all     that has lasted for over 70 years. And today? It will not be long now before the politicians of my generation     are no longer subject to the program of \"Exercising Leadership,\" but at most     will be dealt with in \"Leadership in History.\"     Dear Harvard Class of 2019: Your generation will face the challenges of the     21st century in the coming decades. You are among those who will lead     us into the future.    Protectionism and trade conflicts endanger free world trade and thus the     foundations of our prosperity. The digital transformation covers all areas of     our lives.     Wars and terrorism lead to displacement and forced migration. Climate change     threatens our planet\\'s natural resources. It and the resulting crises are caused by     humans. So we can and must do everything humanly possible to really get     this challenge to humanity under control. This is still possible. But everyone     has to do their part and -- I say this self-critically -- get better.     Therefore, I will do my utmost to ensure that Germany, my country, will     reach the      goal of climate neutrality by 2050.     Change for the better is possible if we tackle it together.     Going it alone, we will not succeed. And so this is my second thought for you:     More than ever we have to think and act multilaterally instead of     unilaterally, global instead of national, cosmopolitan rather than     isolationist. In short, together instead of alone.     You, dear graduates, will in the future have quite different     opportunities for this than my     generation did. After all, your smartphone probably has far more computing power than     the IBM mainframe replicated by the Soviet Union, which I was allowed to     use in 1986 for my dissertation in the GDR.     Today, we use Artificial Intelligence to scan millions of images for     symptoms of disease -- for example, to better diagnose cancer. In the     future, empathic robots could help doctors and caregivers to focus on     the individual needs of individual patients. We can not say what     applications will be possible, but the opportunities that come with [AI]     are truly breathtaking.     Class of 2019, it is essentially up to you as to how we will take advantage     of these opportunities. It will be you who will decide how our way of     working, communicating, moving, and even developing our way of life will     evolve.     As Federal Chancellor, I often have to ask myself: Am I doing the right thing?     Am I doing something because it is right, or just because it\\'s possible?     You should ask yourself that again and again -- and that is my third     thought for you today: Do we set the rules of technology or does     technology determine how we interact? Do we focus on people with their     dignity in all its many facets, or do we only see the customer, the     data sources, the objects of surveillance?     These are difficult questions. I have learned that answers to difficult     questions can be found if we always see the world through the eyes of     others; if we respect the history, tradition, religion, and identity of     others; if we firmly stand by our inalienable values and act     accordingly; and if we do not always follow our initial impulses, even with     all the pressure to make snap decisions, but instead stop for a moment, keep     quiet, think, take a break.     Of course, that takes a lot of courage. Above all, it requires being     truthful to others and perhaps most importantly to ourselves. Where better     to begin with it than here, in this place, where so many young people from     all over the world come to learn under the     motto of Truth     -- to do     research, and discuss the questions of our time? This implies that we do     not describe lies as truth and truth as lies.2    As well, it implies that we do not accept grievances as our normality.     But what, dear graduates, could stop you -- what could hinder us from     doing that? Again,     there are walls: walls in the mind, walls of ignorance and     narrow-mindedness. They exist between members of a family as well as     between social groups, between those of different skin colors, peoples, religions.3    I would like us     to break down these walls -- walls that repeatedly prevent us from     communicating about the world in which we want to live together.     Whether we succeed is up to us. Therefore, dear graduates, my fourth     thought is this: Take nothing for granted. Our individual freedoms are     not self-evident; democracy is not self-evident; neither is peace nor prosperity.     But if we tear down the walls4    that restrict us, if we open the door and     embrace new beginnings, then everything is possible. Walls can collapse.     Dictatorships can disappear. We can stop global warming. We can overcome     hunger. We can eradicate diseases. We can give people, especially girls,     access to education. We can fight the causes of displacement and forced     migration.     We can do all this.   So let us not ask first what is wrong or what has always been. Let      us first     ask what is possible and look for something that has never been done     before.5      It was these exact words     I spoke in 2005 during my very first     policy statement, as the newly elected Federal Chancellor of the     Federal Republic of Germany, as the first woman in this office, in the     German Bundestag, the German Parliament.     And with these words I would like to share with you my fifth thought:     Let us surprise ourselves with what is possible -- let us surprise     ourselves with what we can do.     In my own life, it was the      fall of the Berlin Wall that allowed me to     step out into the open almost 30 years ago. At that time, I left behind my work as a     scientist and went into politics. It was an exciting and magical time,     just as your lives will be exciting and full of magic. But I also     had moments of doubt and worry. For we all knew what lay behind us, but not     what might lie ahead. Perhaps you\\'re feeling a bit like that today     amidst all the joy of the occasion.     Therefore, as my sixth thought, I can also tell you this: The moment     you stand out in the open is also a moment of risk. Letting go of the old     is part of a new beginning. There is no beginning without an end, no day without     night, no life without death. Our whole life consists of this     difference, the space between the beginning and the ending. What\\'s     in between, we call life and experience.     I believe that we must always be ready to finish things to feel the     magic of beginnings and to make the most of our opportunities. That was     my experience in study, in science, and it\\'s what I have experienced in politics.     And who knows what\\'s in store for me after life as a politician? It is     completely open. Only one thing is clear: It will again be something different     and something new.     That\\'s why I want to leave this wish with you: [1] Tear down walls of     ignorance and narrow-mindedness, for nothing has to stay as it is.     It\\'s six things [to remember]:     [2]    Take     joint action in the interests of a multilateral global world.[3]    Keep     asking yourselves: Am I doing something because it is right or simply     because it\\'s possible?[4]    Don\\'t forget that freedom is never something     that can be taken for granted.[5]    Surprise yourself with what is     possible.[6]    Remember that openness always involves risks. Letting go of     the old is part of the new beginning.     And above all, nothing can be taken     for granted; everything is possible.    Thank you!    Deutsche '},\n",

       "  'transcript': '\\xa0  \\xa0[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from  audio. (2)]Thank you very, very much,  President Keohane. Mrs. Gorbachev, Trustees, faculty, parents, and I should say, Julia  Porter, class president, and certainly my new best friend, Christine Bicknell -- and, of  course, the Class of 1990. I am really thrilled to be here today, and very excited, as I  know all of you must be, that Mrs. Gorbachev could join us.These -- These are exciting times. They\\'re exciting in Washington, and I have  really looked forward to coming to Wellesley. I thought it was going to be fun. I never  dreamt it would be this much fun. So, thank you for that.More than ten years ago, when I was invited here to talk about our  experiences in the People\\'s Republic of China, I was struck by both the natural beauty of  your campus and the spirit of this place.Wellesley, you see, is not just a place but an idea -- an experiment  in excellence in which diversity is not just tolerated, but is embraced. The essence of  this spirit was captured in a moving speech about tolerance given last year by a student  body president of one of your sister colleges. She related the story by Robert Fulghum  about a young pastor, finding himself in charge of some very energetic children, hits upon  the game called \"Giants, Wizards, and Dwarfs.\" \"You have to decide now,\"  the pastor instructed the children, \"which you are -- a giant, a wizard, or a  dwarf?\" At that, a small girl tugging at his pants leg, asked, \"But where do the  mermaids stand?\" And the pastor tells her there are no mermaids. And she says,  \"Oh yes there are -- they are. I am a mermaid.\"Now this little girl knew what she was, and she was not about to  give up on either her identity, or the game. She intended to take her place wherever  mermaids fit into the scheme of things. \"Where do the mermaids stand? All of those who are  different, those who do not fit the boxes and the pigeonholes?\" \"Answer that  question,\" wrote Fulghum, \"And you can build a school, a nation, or a whole  world.\" As that very wise young woman said, \"Diversity, like anything worth  having, requires effort -- effort to learn about and respect difference, to be compassionate  with one another, to cherish our own identity, and to accept unconditionally the same in  others.You should all be very proud that this is the Wellesley spirit. Now  I know your first choice today was Alice Walker -- guess how I know! -- known for The  Color Purple. Instead you got me -- known for the color of my hair. Alice Walker\\'s book  has a special resonance here. At Wellesley, each class is known by a special color. For  four years the Class of \\'90 has worn the color purple. Today you meet on Severance Green  to say goodbye to all of that, to begin a new and a very personal journey, to search for  your own true colors.In the world that awaits you, beyond the shores of   Waban -- Lake Waban, no  one can say what your true colors will be. But this I do know: You have a first class  education from a first class school. And so you need not, probably cannot, live a  \"paint-by-numbers\" life. Decisions are not irrevocable. Choices do come back.  And as you set off from Wellesley, I hope that many of you will consider making three very  special choices.The first is to believe in something larger than yourself, to get  involved in some of the big ideas of our time. I chose literacy because I honestly believe  that if more people could read, write, and comprehend, we would be that much closer to  solving so many of the problems that plague our nation and our society.And early on I made another choice, which I hope you\\'ll make as well.  Whether you are talking about education, career, or service, you\\'re talking about life --  and life really must have joy. It\\'s supposed to be fun.One of the reasons I made the most important decision of my  life, to marry George Bush, is because he made me laugh. It\\'s true, sometimes we\\'ve  laughed through our tears, but that shared laughter has been one of our strongest bonds.  Find the joy in life, because as Ferris Bueller said on his day off, \"Life moves  pretty fast; and you don\\'t stop and look around once in a while, you\\'re going to miss it.\"(I\\'m not going to tell George you clapped more for Ferris than you  clapped for George.)The third choice that must not be missed is to cherish your  human connections: your relationships with family and friends. For several years, you\\'ve  had impressed upon you the importance to your career of dedication and hard work. And, of  course, that\\'s true. But as important as your obligations as a doctor, a lawyer, a  business leader will be, you are a human being first. And those human connections --- with  spouses, with children, with friends -- are the most important investments you will ever  make.At the end of your life, you will never regret not having passed one  more test, winning one more verdict, or not closing one more deal. You will regret time  not spent with a husband, a child, a friend, or a parent.We are in a transitional period right now -- We   are in a transitional period right now, fascinating and  exhilarating times, learning to adjust to changes and the choices we, men and women, are  facing. As an example, I remember what a friend said, on hearing her husband complain to  his buddies that he had to babysit. Quickly setting him straight, my friend told  her husband that when it\\'s your own kids, it\\'s not called babysitting. Now maybe we should adjust faster; maybe we should adjust  slower. But whatever the era twenty -- whatever the era, whatever the times, one thing will never change:  fathers and mothers, if you have children, they must come first. You must read to  your children, and you must hug your children, and you must love your children. Your  success as a family, our success as a society, depends not on what happens in the White  House, but on what happens inside your house.For over fifty years, it was said that the winner of Wellesley\\'s  annual hoop race would be the first to get married. Now they say, the winner will be the  first to become a C.E.O. Both -- Both of those stereotypes show too little tolerance for those who  want to know where the mermaids stand. So -- So I want to offer a new legend: the winner of the  hoop race will be the first to realize her dream -- not society\\'s dreams\\xa0 -- her own  personal dream.And who -- Who knows? Somewhere out in this audience may even be someone  who will one day follow in my footsteps, and preside over the White House as the  President\\'s spouse -- and I wish him well.Well, the controversy ends here. But our conversation is only  beginning. And a worthwhile conversation it has been. So as you leave Wellesley today,  take with you deep thanks for the courtesy and the honor you have shared with Mrs.  Gorbachev and with me.Thank you. God bless you. And may your future be worthy of your  dreams.     Book/CDs by Michael E.

       "  'transcript': ' Members of the Board of Trustees, President White,   Chancellor Herman, distinguished faculty, parents and friends, thank you. I\\'m   truly honored to have been invested with a degree from this extraordinary   university. And it is indeed an honor to speak especially to those whom we will   know as graduates in a few minutes. No doubt you are subconsciously settling in to   hear yet another speaker admonish you to \\x93think big\\x94 and to \\x93make the world   better than you found it.\\x94 In other times, these pieties might have been in   order. These are not normal times; and this will not be a normal graduation   speech. Its first characteristic will be its length. When Chancellor Herman   called and asked me to do this, I said, \"How long do I have to talk?\" He said,   \"Oh, about 35 minutes.\" But, hey, I\\'ve got my degree. And, there\\'s a recession   underway, and we\\'re all cutting back; so this speech will be a little shorter   than that. I\\'m going to start with a story. It\\'s about the   man who created our Foundation.    Ewing Kauffman came of age in the Depression. His mother was so poor   she had to leave the the family farm in Missouri and move to Kansas City to run   a boarding house. When Mr. Kauffman graduated from high school, he went right   into the Navy in World War II. When he got out, he worked for a drug company   \\'til he quit because he was too good a salesman. That\\x92s right. Based on his   commissions, he was out-earning the president -- two years in a row -- and when   his territory was cut back the second time he quit -- claimed to himself he\\'d   never work for anyone else again. He became an entrepreneur. He started    Marion Laboratories, a company that grew to be one of the world\\x92s   largest pharmaceutical firms. Its first drug was invented by Mr. Kauffman   himself, who had never been to college, after hearing his doctor-customers talk   to him about what they thought were calcium deficiencies in pregnant patients.   Mr. Kauffman developed a pregnant -- excuse me -- a calcium supplement by   collecting oyster shells from Kansas City restaurants, extracting the calcium --   sometimes ruining his family\\x92s washing machine -- and making it into pills. He   did all this at night because in the daytime he sold these pills to doctors in   their offices. He called his company Marion Laboratories -- it was his mother\\'s   name -- because he didn\\x92t want his customers to suspect that his company only   had one employee. Within a few years, it would have hundreds, and later   thousands, and eventually tens of thousands. As Mr. Kauffman grew older, he thought about how   to give back to America, as a grateful citizen, for all the opportunity that it   had provided to him. Like others, he conceived of a foundation as his way to say   \\x93thank you\\x94 to America. His philanthropic idea was revolutionary: The Kauffman   Foundation might teach other people, many poor people, how to become   entrepreneurs and to make their own economic destiny. In the bargain, as Mr.   Kauffman saw, the American economy would grow stronger. Importantly, he also saw   entrepreneurs as more likely to give back to others, just as he was doing,   because America was the one place on earth where entrepreneurs could shape their   future and then improve the world for others.   Mr. Kauffman\\x92s foundation, which I am privileged to manage, began in 1993  with a gift of 700 million dollars from his estate. In the intervening years, we\\'ve   given away about 1.5 billion dollars and today we\\'re at least -- we\\'re worth at least that much. When   I hear the phrase, \"Only in America\" I am reminded of Mr. Kauffman and his   foundation. You know, only in America do we have private foundations, like ours,   that are living examples of the gratitude of successful citizens, and who voluntarily apply their fortunes to\\xa0improving our nation\\x92s civic life. At Kauffman, we\\'ve learned much from studying how it is   at the University of Illinois you seem to have such a high propensity to produce   graduates who become entrepreneurs -- and successful entrepreneurs. And as you can see all around this campus by the names on many of the   buildings,  those who have gone before you have been very, very generous in their giving back to   make this  university grow stronger, and incidentally, to make your education a little   cheaper. We should thank all of those who have given   back to Illinois in this way. Some of you might right now be thinking, making a   little promise, forming a little commitment to yourself. It goes like this: \\x93When   I become rich,  maybe as an entrepreneur, I\\x92d like to give back to Illinois.\\x94 Or, \\x93If I get   really rich, maybe  I\\x92ll start a foundation.\\x94 Let\\x92s consider how you might build a fortune that you   could develop and give to improve human welfare. It\\x92s going to be a little harder for   your class, but it can be  done. As you know, and as the president has said, our nation is in recession. Some of you know its painful consequences; you   can hardly find  the job market, let alone a job. But as Americans, we tend to be optimistic --   in part because we know our history. We have faced adversity many times before,   and we have always overcome. While the economy your -- your class faces is bad,   let\\x92s remember  how much worse it was in the past, just as president White suggested a few   minutes ago. The classes of 1932 and 1933 faced the Depression with unemployment respectively   at 23 and 25 percent. The classes of 1937 and \\'38 faced the overlooked \\x93Second   Depression\\x94 --  where unemployment was over 20 percent (incidentally, a recession -- a depression   -- a second bounce of the Depression -- that didn\\'t have to happen but did   because of misdirected federal policy). And, things could be worse yet, than for   those classes. Many in the classes of 1941 to \\'45 and   the classes   of 1951 and \\'52 were commissioned as part of their graduation ceremonies. They   were   called to both defend our nation and to regain the promise of freedom for all   the peoples of   the world. Eight hundred and fifty-five of those brave fellow   alumni of yours   never returned to look upon Alma Mater again. And, we have had worse times even still. My class of 1968 faced the Vietnam   War. In that year alone, 16,528 American were killed in uniform. Vietnam claimed   the lives of  63 graduates of this university. And as president White has said, in 1980 and in   1981 and \\'82, the graduating classes faced what we had to call \\x93stagflation.\\x94 The economy was shrinking. GDP   was less than -- was negative 2   percent. Unemployment was over 10 percent. And worse, inflation was out of control with prices   rising at   [1]3.5 percent a year in 1980. Mortgage interest,   by the way, ran as high as 15 percent, and   the cost of   medicine was rising at more than 18 percent a year. So now that I\\'ve given you the basis for optimism   -- Things could be a lot worse and yet American recovered -- let\\'s turn to   today\\'s work.\\xa0  Your immediate task is to figure out what you will do with your   career. And I am   urging you to consider a vocation of entrepreneurship. You may not realize it, but   wanting to become an   entrepreneur is   a much more common opinion -- option than many people think. More than 50 percent of graduating seniors   today, this year, will already decide   that someday   they want to start their own business, work for themselves, and make the world a   better place at their hands with their firm. The same holds true for those getting professional   degrees, and for advanced degrees in the sciences as well. And at Illinois this number is higher   than on the national average. You know that this is one way where you can help   yourselves and at the same time make an enormous contribution to society. The   new companies that you will begin will create jobs, just as Mr. Kauffman\\'s   company did for his neighbors and for his communities. By starting a businesses,   you will make new wealth and   will enhance your   communities. In time, like Mr. Kauffman, you will be able to share voluntarily   the fortunes you have made to thank America for what it set in place for you   today, in the past, and in the future. Are there other worthy things to do?   Other worthy causes? Of course. Some of you, like me, will   choose to   work in the non-profit world. Before business even had a name,   before we had invented the   modern firm, the human family knew that charitable activity was the   complete   expression of love. Many people see becoming an entrepreneur and   working in the non-profit sector as life   choices that couldn\\x92t be farther apart. This view is not helped by graduation   speakers who   tell graduates that, to be a good person and to have careers that will provide   meaning to their lives, they should do just about anything except work in the   private sector in profit-making   companies. Graduates are being told that a career in government is where they   can do the   most good; or that by working for   NGOs they can accomplish something that \\x93really   matters\\x94;   or that working for a non-profit is what the best and the brightest of you should aspire to. Indeed, there is such a thing, happily, as a non-profit entrepreneur -- someone who uses   market forces, or learns from for-profit firms, how   to do great things on a big scale without the profit motivation. This year, over   50 of your fellow alumnus, your classmates, have chosen to spend the first two   years of their career in  Teach for America. This private, non-profit organization will deploy   about 3500 young   men and   women as part of a large-scale attempt to reform America\\x92s public   schools from the   inside out. We, as citizens, should all be grateful to those folks from Illinois   who will go into America\\'s ghettos, and our poor schools, and devote   themselve[s] to teaching kids in a way that teachers with your backgrounds are   seldom able to do.\\xa0  It is the example of just this type of alumni going into non-profit work that prompts   many people   to smile and observe with approval that these are the graduates who must be \"following   their hearts.\\x94 But this discounts the thoughtful choice reflected in their   decision to go forward for two years into America\\'s ghettos and to Teach for America,  or to work for similar, high-impact, non-profit   organizations. And by the way, it   implicitly suggests that if you choose a career in business you don\\x92t have much   of a heart.   From my perspective, having worked both in business and in the non-profit    sector, it seems   to me that the call to service, be it in business or the non-profit world, is   pretty much the same thing. Speaking of service of others though -- to others, there   are among you 43 young men and women who, tomorrow morning, will be commissioned   as young officers in the the Army,   the Navy, the Air   Force, and United States Marine Corps. In putting their very lives at risk to protect this   wonderful country,   they enter a different level of service altogether. We are grateful to you   for your courage   and readiness to protect us. And you grace your class and all of us with your example. Apart from military service and perhaps service in the clergy, to suggest that a   career in the   non-profit world is intrinsically better or more virtuous or more honorable than   working in   business is to advance a false dichotomy. The choice that awaits you is not one   between head and heart. Most likely the choice you make will be one where you satisfy your heart by   using   your head.   Most of you will make your way into the private sector. You will be nurses,   and lawyers, and professors, architects, scientists, designers, salespeople, and builders. You   will work with for-profit firms. Your head, if you are like   most people, will  take you into business. And as millions of people before you have done, you will   take your   heart along with you. Think about the people working in companies founded by   Illinois  graduates that make things that immensely improve our lives everyday: PayPal,   Netscape, Safari,  Delta Airlines, Black Entertainment Television, Oracle, and, of course, Mortal   Combat.  These companies help to make the world we enjoy. The people who work in them pour their hearts into their work for our benefit.   And the  entrepreneurs who thought them up directly contributed, with their initial   ideas, to the quality  of life we enjoy. Any successful business reflects the combination of   ideas joined with an important   expression of love through service to other humans. It\\x92s really how business   works. Greedy   bankers on Wall Street, abetted by corrupt politicians in Washington, cannot be   allowed to   operate as the poster boys of Congress [business]. Listen to President -- Listen to President Obama\\'s   words a few days ago at Arizona State [University], as he described the work   of business leaders whom the President said we should \"revere\" not just respect. He says that they   are the people who are involved in   creating quality products and being committed to their customers, and being   committed to the welfare of their   workers, in seeking increase of wealth for their   shareholders, and improving their communities. He is saying that service is the moral   grounding of good   business. Consider the story of   Chris Michel,   someone I know well. He graduated from Illinois and served as an   officer in   the U.S. Navy. He saw that returning veterans needed help transitioning   to civilian life.   Among other things that Chris saw, was that the federal government\\x92s bureaucracy was so   clunky that   good men and women couldn\\x92t even get the benefits they had earned. Chris\\x92s   insight turned   into a passion, and then it turned into a website, and then it turned into a company.  Military.com  was a great idea. It\\'s helped millions of returning veterans. But Military.com   is also an expression of love. There is no other way to see it. It was formed   purely to help others. Subsequently by the way, Chris has gone on as a   serial entrepreneur to create a new company,  Affinity Labs,   which provides online job markets   and peer-support communities for nurses, policemen, firefighters, and many other   public service   professionals. Chris, like Mr. Kauffman   inventing drugs, is doing well by doing   good. And Chris is using the power of a profit-making firms to reach and serve many   more veterans than any similar non-profit assistance organization could ever   hope to do. I hope I have persuaded you to consider becoming   an entrepreneur. For you, coming to this university -- where entrepreneurship   seems to be part of the DNA around here -- you inherit this mantle. Becoming an   entrepreneur should be a reasonable, perhaps even a self-evident, choice. But there\\'s another reason you must consider becoming an entrepreneur. America,   right now, needs you. We need an army of the smartest, most passionate young   people   to try their hand at a business -- people who will take their hearts and their heads    into the market, founding companies that will bring forth new products and   services that will   help mankind. The major problems of today -- global warming, better and cheaper   health care, our scandalously bad public school system, and the decay of our   cities -- all  these are problems that to entrepreneurs should look like opportunities. Why do we need more entrepreneurs right now? The entrepreneurs who create and run our businesses, who play by the rules,   are in fact   critical to our success as a nation. We need them especially today. First, we   need them to solve the current crisis. Business, not government, will end this recession. Government   must help by   creating fair rules, sound monetary policy, and by protecting our fellow   citizens in periods   where they are jobless. But government has to stand to the side and let new   entrepreneurial   firms challenge companies that can no longer compete. We have to make way for   the new   entrepreneurial firms that will push us to frontiers of innovation. For example,   we need new   car companies, founded by engineers from the University of Illinois, who will   give us safer,   cleaner, and more fuel-efficient automobiles than Washington can design or that   Detroit can build. One such company already  exists. Many of you want to own a Telsa someday -- a  Tesla --\\xa0   excuse me -- someday.  Martin Eberhard, who holds both his bachelor\\x92s   degree and his master\\x92s degree from Illinois, is a cofounder of Tesla, which   builds, as many of you know, the world\\'s fastest, most beautiful electric cars.  Second, in addition to solving a recession, we   need more entrepreneurs to continuously contribute to the expansion of human   welfare through innovation. We need new kinds of products, revolutionary technologies such   as YouTube, two of whose founders   studied right here at Illinois. We need entirely new approaches to customer service,   such as the one  another Illini graduate, Tom Seibel, invented. Think about the   contribution of the   late Illinois professor  Paul Lauterbur, who, by inventing the    MRI, has saved   countless lives and  reduced morbidity for millions. You see, entrepreneurs, Illinois entrepreneurs,   have made the  world a much, much better place. Third, entrepreneurs form the other half of the symbiosis between business and   the non-profit   sector. Without entrepreneurs and the new firms they create, they news jobs they   make -- firms that create   nearly all the  new jobs in our economy every year -- we would have no new wealth to support   either government or the charitable sector. Government can\\x92t create   wealth; non-profit organizations cannot create wealth. Only for-profit firms can create wealth,   and with their taxes and the charitable donations of their employees secure our   economy\\x92s future for those who cannot be competent to operate in the market by   themselves. And entrepreneurs are central to this process. Finally, entrepreneurs play the key role in the   drama of economic growth. It is entrepreneurs who are the ground-up force that   helps us renew our society\\x92s hope for tomorrow. New businesses are the outlet   for a special kind of human creativity. They reflect the striving for human   authenticity and commercial ways which benefit all mankind. In addition to bringing forth inventions   and innovations   that we didn\\x92t even know we needed, entrepreneurs, by creating new jobs, provide   expanding dignity to the human family. Entrepreneurs have always been the engine   of economic renewal. It is they who renew democratic capitalism every time they   choose to take the risk of starting a new company.  In America, economic growth has never been viewed as a happy accident. We have   always   sought growth and embraced the economic vitality that has made ours the economy   that has grown more than   any   other in history. Growth, in America, has been the great alleviator of poverty,   not just in the United States, but in large parts of the world.   Growth has been the   rationale for remaining open to talented and oppressed peoples from around the   world. Growth has   been the engine of social mobility. Growth has been the prerequisite for all of our   progress in the  sciences. Growth is the key ingredient in the glue that holds our society together. And the only way to grow is to create -- new products, new services, new   business models,   new companies, new jobs, and new wealth. It is the entrepreneur\\x92s personal and,   at the same time, the entrepreneur\\'s social   mission. The foundation of our economy is the hundreds of thousands of   businesses -- some of which will grow to be large; some of which will remain   small -- that are formed every year. They create our new jobs. They bring forth   the new and being a   part of that story   is a special form of community -- in national, and even international service.    Not so incidentally, many of our most successful entrepreneurs have been first   generation immigrants. This should not be surprising. The entrepreneurs of   earlier times were all immigrants. To look at their success should be a lesson   on why we must keep America an open and receptive land to the talent that the   world sends here. I hope that in time our government will see the wisdom of   encouraging the world\\'s smartest talent to come here to study, to stay here, to   become citizens, and to become part of this wonderful new generation of   Americans who renew the promise of that all of us in America inherit; and to   start the next generation of the world\\'s most exciting businesses.  Your task is to form your class, your cohort into America\\x92s most   entrepreneurial   generation in her whole history. I urge you to embrace it. Take all that you have learned   here and bring   it into business. Apply it to that idea sitting in the back of your mind. If you   haven\\x92t had that  flash of inspiration yet, be patient.   Julie   Child didn\\'t write her first book until she was 50.    Harlan Sanders started Kentucky Fried Chicken with his first social   security check. A big idea   could be coming.  But maybe one won\\x92t. You don\\x92t have to be Bill   Gates or Thomas Edison or Henry Ford to   make a difference. Thousands of less famous entrepreneurs have done more than   their part   to enrich this country and their fellow citizens. Many have used their   entrepreneurial talents   inside existing businesses remaking companies like IBM and UPS. And thousands have  provided the indispensable help to make entrepreneurial dreams reality   in young   companies and in established businesses. Our future and the future of those happy children to come, to whom   someday you   will send greetings yourselves, depend on your entrepreneurial ambition, your passion,   your knowledge,   and your skill. The security of America and the job it still must play in the   world to make democracy safe for all depends on your contribution to our economic growth. On behalf of   all the  generations that have gone before, who love this country and who love this   university, we   wish you nothing but the greatest of success.  Thank you.

       "  'transcript': 'I\\'ve come to you this morning with   a topic that probably in an earlier age would have sounded a little bit absurd.   And that\\x92s the question of whether character matters, whether it has anything to   do with public service.Now even as recently as a generation ago, probably   no one would give a commencement talk on that address to educated people -- people   getting their degree -- because education was considered to be not only the   acquisition of knowledge, but the formation of moral character. That\\x92s what   education was all about.As a matter of fact, the president of Harvard   University, until the middle of the last century, personally taught the courses in   ethics. Every college in America before the twentieth century was started by   Christians, with one exception, the University of South Carolina. Even when I   was at Brown in the 1950\\'s, chapel was mandatory.Can you imagine in that liberal   bastion today? How dramatically things have changed. And so, we have taken the   moral component out of culture. Teddy Roosevelt, President Teddy Roosevelt,   understood exactly where that would lead us. He said, \\x93To educate a man in the   mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to society.\\x94Thank God for institutions like   Geneva, where you still care about educating people not only in the   mind but in the conscience and in the moral education and formation as well.Even in our country we\\x92ve gone   through a dramatic and rapid change. Remember the ethical malaise of the   80\\'s with everybody concerned about all of the Wall Street scandals and   Boesky   and Milken and all of those names which are now legend? We went after them with   a vengeance because we knew something was wrong in American life, and there was   an ethical concern. The Washington Post said, \"We\\x92ve reached the point where \\'common decency\\' can no longer be described as common.\" Time   Magazine: \"Hypocrisy,   betrayal, greed unsettle a nation\\x92s soul.\"And we were deeply concerned in the   80\\'s with the question of ethics and moral behavior -- so concerned that we took   Clarence Thomas when he went for his confirmation hearing and tore him apart on   the issue of character, and whether his personal character had anything to do   with what kind of a Supreme Court Justice he would be. And actually, that was a   valid question -- whether the questioning of Thomas was valid or not -- that was a   valid question. Senator John Tower happened to be a friend of mine, was   nominated to be Secretary of Defense. He was denied the nomination to be   Secretary of Defense because of womanizing and drinking allegations, perhaps   rightly so. Bob Packwood was driven from the Senate for, who had a long and   distinguished career in the United States Senate, for unseemly behavior with   women, rightly so in my opinion.But what has happened just a   decade later in the 90\\'s? In the 90\\'s, to follow the polls -- and what I am going to   say has no partisan overtones of any kind, because I would say this if there was   a Republican in the Whitehouse or a Democrat in the Whitehouse. It makes   absolutely no difference. But if the charges that have been made are correct, if   there\\'s any validity whatsoever -- and I underline the if, and I tell you I pray   daily for the President and for our leaders because my God commands me to do so,   and every one of you should do the same thing.But two thirds of the American   people say that, if indeed the President of the United States committed perjury,   subornation of perjury, tampering with witnesses, and committed a series of   sexual indiscretions that it should make no difference because the country is   doing so well.Even at the same time, 97% of   the American people say that they believe their own moral behavior is   superior to the President. I can only describe it as if a\\xa0 spaceship has   suddenly flown over America and dropped some de-sensitizing nerve gas upon it,   so that everybody\\x92s moral nerve endings have been totally numbed. And it\\'s as if we   don\\x92t care -- that character means nothing -- that it\\x92s okay -- anything you want to do.If you want to go back and do   some summer reading, go back and get  Aldous Huxley\\x92s   Brave New World, written in the late 30\\'s, because he turned out to be the   greater prophet of the latter half of the 20th century, not Orwell with 1984, as we believe. And he said, we would simply be amused into submission   so that the powers, the controller of the State, could take us over -- because   everybody would have free sex, and a soma, a little pill that they would take   that would make them feel good in all occasions. And if you could make   people feel good, they wouldn\\x92t care about anything else. It\\x92s almost as if, God   forbid, that has happened. It was a radically new concept.Now,   let me give you a quiz question. I will ask you to think about this. You   probably know the answer if you studied any philosophy here at Geneva, and I\\x92m   sure you must have. Many of you have at least three degrees. This will be your   final college exam. And if you don\\x92t use it ever again in life, you might appear   on jeopardy and you\\x92ll know the answer.\\x93What was Socrates and his   interlocutors trying to discover in the great classic of philosophy called, The   Republic?\\x94What was the question? Simple   question: \"What is justice?\"And, \"Is it better to appear    just or to be just?\"And if   you read the book you know the great story when, he, Socrates tells the ring of Gyges. And Gyges finds this ring that allows him to do anything that it wants,   invincibility. It allows him to steal the king\\'s throne and his wife. Above all, Gyges seeks to serve his own interests.   And then Socrates asks us, was that the   right thing to do -- even if in the process he was able to appear righteous in   society? America, today, does not ask that question. Instead we ask, \"How will Gyges handle the economy?\"We\\x92ve lost what\\x92s been the   basic question that people have asked all through history: \"What\\x92s justice?\" \"Better to be right, or to appear right?\" Think about it. Everything you do in   your life, every single decision you make, ask yourself, \\x93Is it better to appear   right or to be right?\\x94 And if you answer that question, you will have lives of   nobility and decency and character, and you\\'ll contribute something of worth to your   society and to your culture.What is character? What do we   mean when we use that term. Character is a neutral word. The character of   something is that the character of this [the podium] is that it\\x92s made of wood.\\xa0But the   question is whether we care about good character; whether we care about the kind   of person who has always been perceived not by others, but known to be true   -- in his heart that he believes in truth, justice, nobility, honesty. Or are we a   person who accepts lies, self serving, dishonest, given to the baser passion.   And every society up until this moment has always exalted virtue and said that   bad character is something to be discouraged and the baser passion to be   restrained. Michael Novak says it so beautifully. He said, \\x93A society of   Americans which exalts virtue has 270 million policemen. A society that mocks   virtue can\\x92t hire enough.\\x94 And you know what happens to a society that can\\x92t   hire enough police. The Germans, and the Italians, and the Japanese, and the   Russians found out.Our   Founding Fathers would be   appalled that we would even be asking these questions in this time. Our   government was not a democracy. Our government was never established to be a   democracy. It was established be a Republican form of government. That is, that   we elected representatives who would represent us. And that\\x92s why the Senate of   the United States was never to be elected by direct election, but was to be   appointed by the State. That\\x92s why we still have something most people   think is an anachronism -- and it is not -- the Electoral College; because we would   get 535 people together who would know the President best, and they would cast   the votes for the President, so that the public officials were somehow removed   from the passions of the masses. And they would not rule by poll and focus   groups. But they would have a sense of nobility and that they would therefore be   able to do what was in the best interests of \"the people,\" not necessarily what the   poll told them on that particular given day the people wanted.We\\x92ve totally abandoned that   notion -- given up on the idea that our public officials should be men, as   [Benjamin] Franklin   put it, and women of wisdom and character -- and \"virtue\" was the phrase. Our   Founding Fathers presupposed that our leaders would be people of virtue because   that\\x92s the only way self government could possibly survive; otherwise you   would need police to enforce everything. [John] Adams   said that \"our Constitution was   made only for a [moral and] religious People.\" For any other kind, it would be considered   \"wholly   inadequate.\"Why has this happened? Number   one, in our culture we have witnessed in the last thirty years the systematic   erosion of a belief in truth. If you take one thing away with your degree today,   you should take away an understanding that there is absolute truth, even though   72% of the American people say there is no such thing. There is absolute   truth because Jesus Christ said, \\x93I am the Truth.\\x94 There is ultimate reality.   God has created us. He has spoken. There is a known physical order. There is a   known moral order; because God has created it, even in a society which says   there is no such thing. It\\x92s true; there is.And if there\\x92s truth, you have   the capacity to know what is right and what is wrong. And if you can\\x92t define   what is right and wrong in a culture, you are headed for the kind of moral nihilism   we\\x92re experiencing today. Samuel Johnson, the great British writer, once said   when he was told a guest was coming to dinner who believed that morality was a   sham, he said -- he roared back -- he said, \\x93If he believes there\\'s no difference   between virtue and vice, let us count the spoons before he leaves.\\x94 Trouble is   students are buying this stuff. Chronicles [sic] of Higher Education reports the most   terrifying things that students say when they\\x92re asked about whether something   is absolutely right or not, including an article I read recently, in which one   writer called it absolute phobia, absolute-a-phobia -- that the students could not   say categorically that Nazis atrocities were wrong.We\\x92ve come that far in a   relativistic culture. We\\x92ve begun to confuse celebrity and fame with virtue, so   that there\\x92s no difference between a Dennis Rodman and a Reggie White. There\\x92s   no difference between somebody who gives all of his money to the poor, as Reggie   White does, and tries to help people who are in need -- and someone who makes a   complete fool of himself as a public spectacle. Fame is fame. And we\\x92ve lost the   distinction between vice and virtue. We\\x92ve raised a generation without   conscience, which is why in the work that I do in the prisons I travel from place   to place and I see people say that --I see these kids, and I see them say, \"There   is no right and wrong!\" And then I see their cold eyes. And then I understand why   Jonesboro happened, and why    Paducah happened, and why here in Pittsburgh not so   many days ago, a student walked in and shot his teacher. And then I understand   why students, kids, up in Central Park in New York cut somebody apart in the   middle of the night that they stumbled onto, and they disemboweled him, and they disfigured his face. And people say,   \"Well that was poverty\" or \"minority.\" Nonsense.   They were all white kids and they were all from an upper middle class in New   York, an upper middle class family. Don\\x92t tell me that. It\\x92s because we haven\\x92t   instilled conscience in people, because we have abandoned virtue and we\\x92ve said   character doesn\\x92t matter. And these kids are beginning to believe it.The third thing we\\x92ve done,   which is appalling, is that we have basically said that what we do with our   bodies -- I want you to think about it -- what we do with our bodies has   nothing to do with our real self. In the last thirty years, we\\'ve embarked upon   an experiment in this country, largely fueled by the sexual revolution and the   idea that a sexual privilege and right is the highest enshrined   constitutionally-protected right in our culture. And we\\x92ve said what we do with   our bodies has nothing to do with our real self. It\\x92s a modern form of dualism.   We have separated what every culture has believed, what the Christian knows to   be body, mind, and spirit being one -- and we\\x92ve said that the body is simply an   instrument. We can use it any way we want. The Christian doctrine is totally   opposite of that. It says the body is part of us and so valuable to God that it   will be resurrected on that great day when he returns and raises us from dead.   It is so vital that marriage is considered a covenant relationship in which two   bodies come together and make one flesh. And we\\x92ve abandoned that: We say that   the body is like an automobile: I can get in it and drive it and take it   anyplace I want and use it for pleasure and simply do anything I want. It\\x92s the   absolute destruction. The problem is that is how we dis-integrate individuals.   Because we disintegrate mind, body, and spirit. And you disintegrate that --   disintegrated people cannot form integrated relationships toward others.   Disintegrated people create disintegrated societies, precisely what we have   done.What is integrity? Integrity is   wholeness. Any of you in the crowd ever been on the Navy? You\\x92ve been aboard a   Naval ship? You know what happens when that ship takes off? I see some hands   going up. But someone goes up to the captain on the   bridge -- the captain on the bridge says check for watertight integrity. And   someone goes down through the ship and they check every single door to see that   every door, every waterproof door, is sealed. And they go back up and they say,   \"The ship has integrity.\" Integrity means every part of your body. It does not   mean every part of your life. It means every single part of your existence. All   those water tight doors are shut tight. And then there is integrity. You cannot   say that someone can do something on the private side of their lives without it   having public consequences, because you\\x92ve opened one of those watertight doors   and that ship will eventually sink. A cheat in private is going to be a cheat in   public. Someone who lies in private is going to lie in public, and you can\\x92t   trust someone who does that. I   want to leave you with a thought, which I guess today is a radical thought. One   would never think we would reach the point in America where this would be a   radical thought. I want you to go out of here not only being educated men and   women who have been privileged, privileged to have one of the great educations   you can receive from one of the great institutions in America, one which has   it\\x92s roots deep in 150 years of proud tradition of service to God and the   country, which cares about the quality of education. But I want you to go out of   here not only people who are educated, but people who are going to strive all of   your life for integrity and character and purity and virtue and that you\\x92re   going to make a difference in your lives by the moral examples that you set. Who   would have thought that had to be necessary to say? It ought to be in your   families. It ought to be in your businesses. It ought to be in all of the   relationships of your life.I   was a marine officer. When you\\x92re trying to go into combat, the most important   thing is that the fellow in the next foxhole you can depend on to be there if   the shooting begins. I cared a whole lot more about his character than I did his   IQ, because my life depended on his character. And as you go through life,   whether it\\x92s in the military, or whether it\\x92s in your businesses, or whether it\\x92s   in your churches, or whatever walk of life, and certainly in your family,   someone is gonna to depend more on your character than your IQ.Build and   develop your character.How do you do it?It\\x92s essential;   it\\'s essential to   freedom.  Well, we all have the greatest message of all: \"Whoever can be trusted with very   little can also be trusted with much.\" Respect others. Speak the truth.   Simply \"let your \\'yes\\' be yes\" -- your \"\\'no\\'\\' no.\" Act justly. \"Do justly.\" \"Love mercy.\"   \"Walk   humbly with your God.\" \"Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right,   whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable, if anything is   excellent or praiseworthy think about such things.\" \"Fear God and keep His   commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.\" \"Who may live on your holy hill?   He whose walk is blameless and who does what is righteous; who speaks the truth   from his heart and has no slander on his tongue; who does his neighbor no   wrong and casts no slur on his fellow man; who despises a vile man but honors   those who fear the Lord; who keeps his oath, his word,\"   even when it hurts. \"Stop   doing wrong.\" \"Learn to do right.\" \"Seek justice.\" \"Encourage the oppressed.\" \"Defend   the cause of the fatherless.\" \"Plead the cause of the widow.\" C.S.   Lewis, born a hundred years ago this year -- C.S. Lewis wrote with prophetic   insight into what was happening into American culture and western culture.   He said   this in a book which we wrote in the 40s,2  in an article called, The Poison of   Subjectivism:  The very idea of freedom presupposes some objective moral law   which overarches rulers and rules alike. Subjectivism about values is eternally   incompatible with democracy. We and our rulers are of one kind only so long as   we are subject to one law. But if there is no Law of Nature, the ethos of   any society is the creation of its rulers, educators\" -- and a wonderful word he   uses -- \"conditioners. Unless we return to the crude   and nursery-like belief in objective values, we perish. My   single message to you today, as you depart this great institution: Do your duty.Twenty-five years ago this summer, I was converted to Christ. And everyday that   I get up in the morning, I thank God for that moment when I realized my own sin,   and I knew that as an historical fact, the son of God went to the cross and took   upon himself my sin.Twenty-five years ago, in the darkest days of   Watergate,   you read about all of my sins -- those of you graduating now. Younger   students at least read about them in your history books. I am always appalled   when people come up to me and ask for my autograph on airplanes because they   read about me in their history book.But   what I realized that night, twenty-five years ago, the toughest of the Nixon   tough guys, the Whitehouse \"Hatchet Man,\" was that it was true that I could be set   free, and I realized what was in my heart -- not the stuff you read about in Watergate, but much worse. And I tell you I would suffocate in the   stench of my own sins today if I did not know that Christ took them away.And   what does that do with me?That inspires in me what Chesterton said is the   \"mother of all virtues.\" That inspires in me a sense of gratitude that I will do   for my God whatever He calls me to do. And   what he calls us to do is to live for him in biblical fidelity to the kinds of   commands I read to you from the Holy Scriptures, and to be men and women of   character who exalt virtue and go into a society which has disdained character,   which is laughing at honor, which is mocking virtue, and saying, \"No, we believe   in truth, and we\\x92re going to live our lives that way no matter what the cost.\" Be   those kind of men and women. God Bless you. 1  From John Adams to Massachusetts Militia, 11 October   1798.

       "  'transcript': ' Dr. Wong, Dr. Keough,      Mrs. Novogroski, Ms. Curran, members of the board of education,      family and friends of the graduates, ladies and gentlemen of the      Wellesley High School class of 2012, for the privilege of speaking      to you this afternoon, I\\'m honored and grateful. Thank you. So here we are,      commencement, life\\x92s great forward-looking ceremony. And don\\x92t say,      \"What about weddings?\" Weddings are one-sided and insufficiently      effective. Weddings are bride-centric pageantry. Other than      conceding to a list of unreasonable demands, the groom just stands      there -- no stately, hey-everybody-look-at-me procession; no being      given away; no identity-changing pronouncement. And can you imagine      a television show dedicated to watching guys try on tuxedos? Their      fathers sitting there misty-eyed with joy and disbelief; their      brothers lurking in the corner muttering with envy. Left to men,      weddings would be, after limits-testing procrastination,      spontaneous, almost inadvertent -- during halftime, on the way to the      refrigerator. And then there\\x92s the frequency of failure: statistics      tell us half of you will get divorced. A winning percentage like      that\\x92ll get you last place in the American League East. The      Baltimore Orioles do better than weddings. But this ceremony,      commencement, a commencement works every time. From this day      forward, truly, in sickness and in health, through financial      fiascos, through midlife crises and passably attractive sales reps      at trade shows in Cincinnati (parents get that), through diminishing      tolerance for annoyingness, through every difference, irreconcilable      and otherwise, you will stay forever graduated from high school, you      and your diploma as one, \\x91til death do you part. No, commencement is      life\\x92s great ceremonial beginning, with its own attendant and highly      appropriate symbolism. Fitting, for example, this -- for this auspicious      rite of passage, is where we find ourselves this afternoon, the      venue. Normally, I avoid clichés like the plague, wouldn\\x92t touch      them with a ten-foot pole, but here we are on a literal level      playing field. That matters. That says something. And your      ceremonial costume -- shapeless, uniform, one-size-fits-all. Whether      male or female, tall or short, scholar or slacker, spray-tanned prom      queen or intergalactic X-Box assassin, each of you is dressed,      you\\x92ll notice, exactly the same; and your diploma, but for your      name, exactly the same. All of this is as it      should be -- because none of you is special. You\\x92re not special. You\\'re not exceptional. Contrary to what your U9      soccer trophy suggests, your -- your glowing 7th grade report card, despite      every assurance of a       certain corpulent purple dinosaur, that nice     Mister Rogers and your batty Aunt Sylvia, no matter how often your      maternal caped crusader has swooped in to save you -- you\\x92re nothing      special. Yes, you\\x92ve been      pampered, cosseted, doted upon, helmeted, bubble-wrapped. Yes,      capable adults with other things to do have held you, kissed you,      fed you, wiped your mouth, wiped your bottom, trained you, taught      you, tutored you, coached you, listened to you, counseled you,      encouraged you, consoled you, and encouraged you again. You have been      nudged, cajoled, wheedled, and implored. You\\x92ve been feted and fawned      over and called \"sweetie pie.\" Yes, you have. And certainly, we\\x92ve      been to your games, your plays, your recitals, your science fairs.      Absolutely, smiles ignite when you walk into a room, and hundreds      gasp with delight at your every tweet. Why, maybe you\\x92ve even had      your picture in the  Townsman. And now you\\x92ve conquered high school;      and, indisputably, here we all have gathered for you, the pride and      joy of this fine community, the first to emerge from that      magnificent new building. But do not get the idea      you\\x92re anything special -- because you\\x92re not. The empirical evidence      is everywhere, numbers even an English teacher can\\x92t ignore. Newton,      Natick -- I\\'m allowed to say Needham, yes? -- that has to be 2000 high school graduates right there, give or take, and that\\x92s      just the neighborhood N\\x92s.  Across the country no fewer than 3.2      million seniors are graduating about now from more than 37,000 high      schools. That\\x92s 37,000      valedictorians; that\\x92s 37,000 class presidents, 92,000 harmonizing      altos, 340,000 swaggering jocks, 2,185,967 pairs of      Uggs. But why      limit ourselves to high school? After all, you\\x92re leaving it. So      think about this: Even if you\\x92re one in a million, on a planet of      6.8 billion that means there are nearly 7,000 people just like you.      Imagine standing somewhere over there on Washington Street on      Marathon Monday watching 6800 \"yous\" go running by.  And      consider for a moment the bigger picture: Your planet, I\\x92ll remind      you, is not the center of its solar system; your solar system is not      the center of its galaxy; your galaxy is not the center of the      universe. In fact, astrophysicists assure us the universe has no      center; therefore, you cannot be \"it.\" Neither can Donald      Trump,\\xa0 which someone should tell him, although the hair is quite a      phenomenon. \"But Dave,\" you cry,      \"Walt Whitman tells me...I\\x92m my own      version of perfect.\" \"Epictetus      tells me I have the spark of Zeus.\" And I don\\x92t disagree. So that      makes 6.8 billion examples of perfection, 6.8 billion sparks of      Zeus. You see, if everyone is      special, then no one is. If everyone gets a trophy, trophies become      meaningless. In our unspoken but not-so-subtle Darwinian competition      with one another -- which springs, I think, from our fear of our own      insignificance, a subset of our dread of mortality -- we have of      late, we Americans, to our detriment, come to love accolades more      than genuine achievement. We have come to see them as the point,      and we\\x92re happy to compromise standards, or ignore reality, if we      suspect that\\x92s the quickest way, or only way, to have something to      put on the mantelpiece, something to pose with, crow about,      something with which to leverage ourselves into a better spot on the      social totem pole. No longer is it how you      play the game, no longer is it even whether you win or lose, or      learn or grow, or enjoy yourself doing it. Now it\\x92s \"So what does      this get me?\" As a -- As a consequence, we cheapen worthy endeavors, and      building a Guatemalan medical clinic becomes more about the      application to       Bowdoin than the well-being of Guatemalans. It\\x92s an epidemic -- and      in its way, not even dear old Wellesley High is immune -- one of the      best of the 37,000 nationwide, Wellesley High School -- where good is      no longer good enough, where a B is the new C, and the mid-level      curriculum is called Advanced College Placement. And I hope you      caught me when I said \"one of the best.\" I said \"one of the best\" so      we can feel better about ourselves, so we can bask in a little easy      distinction, however vague and unverifiable, and count ourselves      among the elite, whoever they might be, and enjoy a perceived leg up      on the perceived competition. But the phrase defies logic. By -- By definition there can be only one best. You\\x92re it or      you\\x92re not. If you\\x92ve learned      anything in your four years I hope it\\x92s that education be for -- should be      for, rather than material advantage, the exhilaration of learning.      You\\x92ve learned, too, I hope, as       Sophocles assured us, that wisdom is      the chief element of happiness. Second is ice cream -- just a -- just      an FYI. I also hope you\\x92ve learned enough to recognize how little      you know -- how little you know now, at the moment, for today is just      the beginning. It\\x92s where you go from here that matters. As you commence, then,      and before you scatter to the winds, I urge you to do whatever you      do for no reason other than you love it and believe in its      importance.  Don\\x92t bother with work you      -- work you don\\x92t believe in any more      than you would a spouse you\\x92re not crazy about, lest you too find      yourself on the wrong side of a Baltimore Orioles comparison. Resist      the easy comforts of complacency, the specious glitter of -- of      materialism, the narcotic paralysis of self-satisfaction. Be worthy      of your advantages. And read. Read all the      time. Read as a matter of principle, as a matter of self-respect.      Read as a nourishing staple of life. Develop and protect a moral      sensibility and demonstrate the character to apply it. Dream big.      Work hard. Think for yourself. Love everything you love, everyone      you love, with all your might. And do so, please, with a sense of      urgency, for every tick of the clock subtracts from fewer and fewer      --\\xa0      and as surely as there are commencements there are cessations, and      you\\x92ll be in no condition to enjoy the ceremony attendant to that      eventuality no -- no matter how delightful the afternoon. The fulfilling life, the      distinctive life, the relevant life, is an achievement, not      something that will fall into your lap because you\\x92re a nice person      or mommy ordered it from the caterer. You\\x92ll note the founding      fathers took pains to secure your inalienable right to life, liberty,      and the pursuit of happiness -- quite an active verb, \"pursuit\" -- which      leaves, I should think, little time for lying around watching      parrots roller skate on YouTube. The first       President      Roosevelt, the old rough rider, advocated the strenuous life. Mr.      Thoreau wanted to drive life into a corner, to live deep and suck      out all the marrow. The poet Mary Oliver tells us to row, row into      the swirl and roil. Locally, someone -- I forget who -- from time to      time encourages young scholars to carpe the heck out of the diem.      The point is the same: Get busy; have at it. Don\\x92t wait for      inspiration or passion to find you. Get up; get out. Explore. Find      it yourself and grab hold with both hands. Now, before you dash off      and get your \"YOLO\" tattoo, let me point out the illogic of that      trendy little expression, because you can and should live not merely      once, but every day of your life. Rather than \"You Only      Live Once,\" it should be \"You Live Only Once\" -- but because \"[Y]LOO\" doesn\\x92t      have the same ring, we shrug and decide it doesn\\x92t matter. None of this      day-seizing, though, this [Y]LOO-ing, should be interpreted as license      for self-indulgence. Like accolades ought to be, the fulfilled life      is a consequence -- a gratifying byproduct. It\\x92s what happens when      you\\x92re thinking about more important things. Climb the mountain not      to plant your flag, but to embrace the challenge, enjoy the air and      behold the view. Climb it so you can see the world, not so the world      can see you. Go to Paris to be in Paris, not to cross it off your      list and congratulate yourself for being worldly. Exercise free will      and creative, independent thought, not for the satisfactions they      will bring you, but for the good they will do others, the rest of      the 6.8 billion -- and those who will follow them. And then you too      will discover the great and curious truth of the human experience is      that selflessness is the best thing you can do for yourself: The      sweetest joys of life, them -- then, come only with the recognition      that you\\x92re not special -- because everyone is. Congratulations. Good      luck.Make for yourselves, please, for your sake and for ours,      extraordinary lives.'},\n",

       "  'transcript': '  We declare our       right on this earth to be a human being, to be respected as a       human being, to be given the rights of a human being in this       society, on this earth, in this day, which we intend to bring       into existence by any means necessary.1  These were the words      of  Malcolm X. Classmates, we are a      family of volunteers -- a family, whether we like it or not -- here      to preserve and to protect our nation and humanity. For the Coast Guard,      \"by any means necessary\" is not simply a willingness to kill, but      more so a willingness to die. This day marks our      legacy. Let us make history. I know I\\x92m up here      today because I\\x92m a nerd, and I managed to be the best number,2      the best piece of paper for the past four years; but I\\x92d like to      think that it\\'s because I have a respect for humanity. I know I\\'m also only      22 years old, so I\\x92m not going to get up here and pretend to be some      pseudo-righteous overachiever who thinks she knows all the answers.      (Yeah.) But I am here to tell      you that I believe in a history and a now that is ours, a      history and a now filled with a consciousness of the human      condition, filled with a respect for human beings. I need you to take      this moment and see that I am black, see that I am a woman. I\\x92m not      going to tell you to close your eyes and imagine anything because we      all to need to look this reality in the face. I need you to see that      I am human -- just like you, no better, no worse. And if we can      accept each others\\x92 humanity, we can make history. (Thank you.) Humanity is our      homeline -- it\\'s our homeland. And classmates, we must remind our      nation of the true definition and dynamic of homeland security.      Protecting renewable energy is securing the homeland. Protecting the      public from terrorists\\' strike is securing the homeland. Treating      all people, whether migrant or felon, with human decency and mercy,      is securing the home[land]. Saving lives is securing the homeland. We must never forget      our legacy. We must never forget the freedom and liberty that make      us America. We have made a pledge to society that on this earth, to      the best of our ability, by any means necessary, we will preserve      and protect humanity. Enemies of the Coast      Guard do not all have faces, do not all breathe. Our enemy is any      thing, concept, or form willing to hurt human beings. And a recent      example of that enemy is      Katrina. We fought back with      principles of humanity -- exploding justice, respect, and freedom.      These principles give our nation a unique strength; and this is the      greatest weapon of all. I simply ask you to      think. I ask you to look back on your moments of powerlessness. Look      back to that moment where you had to get on your knees and scrub and      sweep and mop and wax and buff and buff and buff and rebuff, and      buff again, a floor that someone was going to walk on and probably      scuff two minutes later. That feeling is what it is to be human. Humble yourself and      accept your humanity -- and don\\'t deny it in others. When you lead      your people, exude that understanding of a struggle and a fight --      and fight for them, and be for them. And in that fight I      ask you to remember this family that surrounds you here today. I ask      you to remember the shipmate that carried your sea bag during      sea trials. I ask you to remember      the shipmate who earned a \"C\" tutoring your \"B+.\" I ask you to      remember the shipmate who stayed by your side -- late night, after      night, after night, after night, knowing you were always more      important than any late rack.3      Remember the shipmate who shined your shoes, the faculty, the coach,      the company officer, who made you shine; the parent, the guardian,      who always knew you could shine. This family is the      foundation of your humanity. These are the people you respect and      who have taught you what it means to respect. These are the      people who have helped you to understand everyone\\'s right, as a      human being, to be on this earth. Our history has not      yet begun -- and it won\\'t begin until all of us cross this stage. Today, we become the      class that we set out to be four years ago.  Today, we become      officers. Today, we become      protectors of the United States\\' Constitution. Today, we must      acknowledge that we are all human -- and maintain that awareness by      any means necessary. Our history is now. Shall we begin?'},\n",

       "  'transcript': '     Thank you very much.     Rain, somebody said, is like confetti from heaven. So even the heavens     are celebrating this morning, joining the rest of us at this wonderful     commencement ceremony.     Before we go any further, graduates, you have an     important task to perform because behind you are your parents and     guardians. Two or three or four years ago, they drove into     Cardigan,     dropped you off, helped you get settled and then turned around and drove     back out the gates. It was an extraordinary sacrifice for them. They     drove down the trail of tears back to an emptier and lonelier house.     They did that because the decision about your education, they knew, was     about you. It was not about them. That sacrifice and others they made     have brought you to this point. But this morning is not just about you.     It is also about them. So I hope you will stand up and turn around and     give them a great round of applause, please.     Now when somebody asks me how the remarks at     Cardigan went, I will be     able to say they were interrupted by applause.     Congratulations, class of     2017. You\\'ve reached an important milestone. An important stage of your     life is behind you. I\\'m sorry to be the one to tell you it is the     easiest stage of your life, but it is in the books.     Now While you\\'ve been at     Cardigan, you have all been a part of an important international     community as well. And I think that needs to be particularly recognized.   También       felicito a los graduados Cardigan de México y a todos los otros       estudiante[s] internacionales. [Su] presencia, como parte de la       comunidad Cardigan, ha hecho un lugar más vibrante.1 [Additional       remarks in Chinese language]      Now around the country today at colleges, high schools, middle schools,     commencement speakers are standing before impatient graduates, and they     are almost always saying the same things. They will say that \"today is a     commencement exercise.\" \"It is a beginning, not an end.\" \"You should look     forward.\"     And I think that is true enough. However, I think if you\\'re     going to look forward to figure out where you\\'re going, it\\'s good to     know where you\\'ve been, and to look back as well. And I think if you look     back to your first afternoon here at Cardigan, perhaps you will recall     that you were lonely. Perhaps you will recall that you were a little     scared, a little anxious. And now look at you. You are surrounded by     friends that you call brothers, and you are confident in facing the next     step in your education.     It is worth trying to think why that is so. And when you do, I think you     may appreciate that it was because of the support of your classmates in     the classroom, on the athletic field, and in the dorms. And as far as the     confidence goes, I think you will appreciate that it is not because you     succeeded at everything you did, but because, with the help of your     friends, you were not afraid to fail. And if you did fail, you got up     and tried again. And if you failed again, you got up and tried again.     And if you failed again, it might be time to think about doing something     else. But it was not just success, but not being afraid to fail that     brought you to this point.     Now the commencement speakers will typically also wish you good luck and     extend good wishes to you. I will not do that and I\\'ll tell you why.   From time to time in the years to come, I hope you will be treated     unfairly, so that you will come to know the value of justice.  I hope     that you will suffer betrayal because that will teach you the importance     of loyalty.  Sorry to say, but I hope you will be lonely from time to     time so that you don\\'t take friends for granted.  I wish you bad luck,     again, from time to time so that you will be conscious of the role of     chance in life and understand that your success is not completely     deserved and that the failure of others is not completely deserved     either.  And when you lose, as you will from time to time, I hope every     now and then your opponent will gloat over your failure. It is a way     for you to understand the importance of sportsmanship.  I hope you\\'ll be     ignored so you know the importance of listening to others.  And I hope     you will have just enough pain to learn compassion.      Whether I wish these     things or not, they\\'re going to happen. And whether you -- you benefit from     them or not will depend upon your ability to see the message in your     misfortunes.     Now commencement speakers are also expected to give some advice. They     give grand advice, and they give some useful tips. The most common grand     advice they give is for you to be yourself. It is an odd piece of advice     to give people dressed identically, but you should -- you should be     yourself. But you should understand what that means.     Unless you are     perfect, it does not mean don\\'t make any changes. In a certain sense,     you should not be yourself. You should try to become something better.     People say \"be yourself\" because they want you to resist the impulse to     conform to what others want you to be. But you can\\'t be yourself if you     don\\'t learn who are, and you can\\'t learn who you are unless you think     about it.2     The Greek philosopher      Socrates said, \"The unexamined life is not worth     living.\" And while \"Just     Do It\" might be a good motto for some things,     it\\'s not a good motto when it\\'s trying to figure out how to live your     life that is before you. And one important clue to living a good life is     to not to try to live the good life.3    The best way to lose the     values that are central to who you are is, frankly, not to think about     them at all.     So that\\'s the deep advice. Now some tips as you get ready to go to your     new school. Over the last couple of years, I have gotten to know many     of you young men pretty well, and I know you are good guys. But you are     also privileged young men. And if you weren\\'t privileged when you came     here, you\\'re privileged now because you have been here. My advice is:     Don\\'t act like it.     When you get to your new school, walk up and introduce yourself to the     person who is raking the leaves, shoveling the snow, or emptying the     trash. Learn their name and call them by their name during your time at     the school. Another piece of advice: When you pass by people you don\\'t     recognize on the walks, smile, look them in the eye, and say hello. The     worst thing that will happen is that you will become known as the young     man who smiles and says hello, and that is not a bad thing to start     with.     You\\'ve been at a school with just boys. Most of you will be going to a     school with girls.  \\xa0        I have no advice for you.     The --    The last bit of advice I\\'ll give you is very simple, but I think it     could make a big difference in your life. Once a week, you should write     a note to someone -- not an email, a note on a piece of paper. It will     take you exactly 10 minutes. Talk to an adult. Let them tell you what a     stamp is. You can put the stamp on the envelope -- again, 10 minutes, once     a week.     I will help you, right now. I will dictate to you the first note you     should write. It will say:   \"Dear\"      -- fill in the name of a teacher at Cardigan Mountain School.     Say:   \"I have started at this new school. We     are reading (blank) in English.\"  \"Football\" (or) \"Soccer practice is hard, but     I\\'m enjoying it.\"  \"Thank you for teaching me.\"      Put it in an envelope. Put     a stamp on it and send it. It will mean a great deal to people who, for     reasons most of us cannot contemplate, have dedicated themselves to     teaching middle school boys.     As I said, that will take you exactly 10     minutes a week. By the end of the school year, you will have sent notes     to 40 people. Forty people will feel a little more special because you     did, and they will think you are very special because of what you did.     No one else is going to carry that dividend during your time at school.     Enough advice.     I would like to end by reading some important lyrics. I     cited the Greek philosopher Socrates earlier. These lyrics are from the     great American philosopher,      Bob Dylan. They\\'re almost 50 years old. He     wrote them for his son, Jesse, who he was missing while he was on tour.     It lists the hopes that a parent might have for a son and for a     daughter. They\\'re also good goals for a son and a daughter. The wishes     are beautiful. They\\'re timeless. They\\'re universal. They\\'re good and     true, except for one: It is the wish that gives the song its title and     its refrain. That wish is a parent\\'s lament. It\\'s not a good wish. So     these are the lyrics from   Forever Young by Bob Dylan:   May God bless you and keep     you alwaysMay your wishes all come trueMay you always do for othersAnd let others do for youMay you build a ladder to the starsAnd climb on every rungAnd may you stay forever young May you grow up to be     righteousMay you grow up to be trueMay you always know the truthAnd see the lights surrounding youMay you always be courageousStand upright and be strongAnd may you stay forever young May your hands always be     busyMay your feet always be swiftMay you have a strong foundationWhen the winds of changes shiftMay your heart always be joyfulMay your song always be sungAnd may you stay forever young   Thank you.'},\n",

       "  'transcript': '  \\xa0[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below   transcribed directly from audio.] Thank you, Mr. President, I had   forgotten how crushingly dull these ceremonies are. Thank you.My best to the choir. I have to say, that song   never grows old for me. Whenever I hear that song, it reminds me of nothing.I am honored to be here, I do have a confession   to make before we get going that I should explain very quickly. When I am not on   television, this is actually how I dress. I apologize, but this is -- thank you.   Thank you. There\\x92s something very freeing about it. I congratulate the students   for being able to walk even a half a mile in this non-breathable fabric in the   Williamsburg heat.

Seriously, it saddens me. As a   person, I\\'m honored to get it; as an alumnus, I have to say I believe we can do   better. And I believe we should. But it has always been a dream of mine to   receive a doctorate and to know that today, without putting in any effort, I   will. It\\x92s incredibly gratifying. Thank you. No, that\\x92s very nice of you, I   appreciate it. Thank you.I\\x92m sure my fellow doctoral graduates -- who   have spent so long toiling in academia, sinking into debt, sacrificing God knows   how many years of what, in truth, is a piece of parchment that has been so   devalued by our instant gratification culture as to have been rendered   meaningless -- will join in congratulating me. Thank you.But today isn\\x92t about how my presence here   devalues this fine institution. It is about you, the graduates. I\\x92m honored to   be here to congratulate you today. Today is the day you enter into the real   world, and I should give you a few pointers on what it is. It\\x92s actually not   that different from the environment here. The biggest difference is you will now   be paying for things, and the real world is not surrounded by three-foot brick   wall. And the real world is not a restoration. If you see people in the real   world making bricks out of straw and water, those people are not colonial   re-enactors -- they are poor. Help them. And in the real world, there is not as   much candle lighting. I don\\x92t really know what it is about this campus and   candle lighting, but I wish it would stop. We only have so much wax, people.Lets talk about the real world for a moment. We   had been discussing it earlier, and I -- I wanted to bring this up to you   earlier about the real world, and -- and this is I guess as good a time as any.   I don\\x92t really know to put this, so I\\x92ll be blunt. We broke it. Please don\\x92t be   mad. I know we were supposed to bequeath to the next generation a world better   than the one we were handed. So, sorry.I don\\x92t know if you\\x92ve been following the news   lately, but it just kinda got away from us. Somewhere between the gold rush of   easy internet profits and an arrogant sense of endless empire, we heard kind of   a pinging noise, and then the damn thing just died on us. So I apologize.But here\\x92s the good news. You fix this thing,   you\\x92re the next greatest generation, people. You do this -- and I believe you   can -- you win this war on terror, and Tom Brokaw\\x92s kissing your ass from here   to Tikrit, let me tell ya. And even if you don\\x92t, you\\x92re not gonna have much   trouble surpassing my generation. If you end up getting your picture taken next   to a naked guy pile of enemy prisoners and don\\x92t give the thumbs up you\\x92ve   outdid us.We declared war on terror. We declared war on   terror\\xa0 -- it\\x92s not even a noun, so, good luck. After we defeat it, I\\x92m   sure we\\x92ll take on that bastard ennui.But obviously that\\x92s the world. What about your   lives? What piece of wisdom can I impart to you about my journey that will   somehow ease your transition from college back to your parents\\' basement?I know some of you are nostalgic today, filled   with excitement and perhaps uncertainty at what the future holds. I know six of   you are trying to figure out how to make a bong out of your caps. I believe you   are members of Psi U. Hey that did work. Thank you for the reference.So I thought I\\x92d talk a little bit about my   experience here at William and Mary. It was very long ago, and if you had been   to William and Mary while I was here and found out that I would be the   commencement speaker 20 years later, you would be somewhat surprised, and   probably somewhat angry. I came to William and Mary because as a Jewish person I   wanted to explore the rich tapestry of Judaica that is Southern Virginia.   Imagine my surprise when I realized \\x93The Tribe\\x94 was not what I thought it meant.In 1980 I was 17 years old. When I moved to   Williamsburg, my hall was in the basement of Yates, which combined the   cheerfulness of a bomb shelter with the prison-like comfort of the group shower.   As a freshman I was quite a catch. Less than five feet tall, yet my head is the   same size it is now. Didn\\x92t even really look like a head, it looked more like a   container for a head. I looked like a Peanuts character. Peanuts characters had   terrible acne. But what I lacked in looks I made up for with a repugnant   personality.In 1981 I lost my virginity, only to gain it   back again on appeal in 1983. You could say that my one saving grace was   academics where I excelled, but I did not.And yet now I live in the rarified air of   celebrity, of mega stardom. My life a series of anonymous Hollywood orgies and   Kabala center brunches with the cast of Friends. At least that\\x92s what my   handlers tell me. I\\x92m actually too valuable to live my own life and spend most   of my days in a vegetable crisper to remain fake news anchor fresh.So I know that the decisions that I made after   college worked out. But at the time I didn\\x92t know that they would. See college   is not necessarily predictive of your future success. And it\\x92s the kind of thing   where the path that I chose obviously wouldn\\x92t work for you. For one, you\\x92re not   very funny.So how do you know what is the right path to   choose to get the result that you desire? And the honest answer is this. You   won\\x92t. And accepting that greatly eases the anxiety of your life experience.I was not exceptional here, and am not now. I   was mediocre here. And I\\x92m not saying aim low. Not everybody can wander around   in an alcoholic haze and then at 40 just, you know, decide to be President.   You\\x92ve got to really work hard to try to...I was actually referring to my   father.When I left William and Mary I was   shell-shocked. Because when you\\x92re in college it\\x92s very clear what you have to   do to succeed. And I imagine here everybody knows exactly the number of credits   they needed to graduate, where they had to buckle down, which introductory   psychology class would pad out the schedule. You knew what you had to do to get   to this college and to graduate from it. But the unfortunate, yet truly exciting   thing about your life, is there is no core curriculum. The entire place is an   elective. The paths are infinite and the results uncertain. And it can be   maddening to those that go here, especially here, because your strength has   always been achievement. So if there\\x92s any real advice I can give you it\\x92s this:   College is something you complete; life is something you experience.So don\\x92t worry about your grade or the results   or success. Success is defined in myriad ways, and you will find it, and people   will no longer be grading you, but it will come from your own internal sense of   decency which I imagine, after going through the program here, is quite strong.   Love what you do. (Although I\\x92m sure downloading illegal files\\x85but, nah, that\\x92s   a different story.)Love what you do. Get good at it. Competence is   a rare commodity in this day and age. And let the chips fall where they may.And the last thing I want to address is the   idea that somehow this new generation is not as prepared for the sacrifice and   the tenacity that will be needed in the difficult times ahead. I have not found   this generation to be cynical or apathetic or selfish. They are as strong and as   decent as any people that I have met. And I will say this, on my way down here I   stopped at Bethesda Naval, and when you talk to the young kids that are there   that have just been back from Iraq and Afghanistan, you don\\x92t have the worry   about the future that you hear from so many that are not a part of this   generation but judging it from above.And the other thing\\x85.that I will say is, when I   spoke earlier about the world being broke, I was somewhat being facetious,   because every generation has their challenge. And things change rapidly, and   life gets better in an instant.I was in New York on 9-11 when the towers came   down. I lived 14 blocks from the twin towers. And when they came down, I thought   that the world had ended. And I remember walking around in a daze for weeks. And   Mayor Giuliani had said to the city, \\x93You\\x92ve got to get back to normal. We\\x92ve   got to show that things can change and get back to what they were.\\x94And one day I was coming out of my building,   and on my stoop, was a man who was crouched over, and he appeared to be in deep   thought. And as I got closer to him I realized, he was playing with himself. And   that\\x92s when I thought, \"You know what, we\\x92re gonna be OK.\"Thank you. Congratulations. I honor you. Good   Night.

       "  'transcript': \" Thank you      all. Thank you so much. Let\\x92s let our graduates rest themselves.\\xa0      You\\x92ve worked hard for those seats! Let me      start by thanking President Johnson for that very gracious      introduction, and for awarding me with this honorary degree from an      extraordinary institution.\\xa0 I am proud to have this degree -- very      proud. Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you so much. I want to      recognize Major General Williams; Congresswoman Sewell; Zachary;      Kalauna; to all of the trustees, the faculty, the staff here at      Tuskegee University.\\xa0 Thank you -- thank you so much for this warm      welcome, this tremendous hospitality.\\xa0 And I'm so glad to be here. Before I      begin, I just want to say that my heart goes out to everyone who      knew and loved      Eric Marks, Jr.\\xa0 I understand he      was such a talented young man, a promising aerospace engineer who      was well on his way to achieving his dream of following in the      footsteps of the      Tuskegee Airmen.\\xa0 And Eric was      taken from us far too soon.\\xa0 And our thoughts and prayers will      continue to be with his family, his friends, and this entire      community. I also have      to recognize the Concert Choir.\\xa0 Wow, you guys are good!\\xa0 Well done! Beautiful song. And I have to join in recognizing all the      folks up in the stands -- the parents, siblings, friends -- so many      others who have poured their love and support into these graduates      every step of the way.\\xa0 Yeah, this is your day. Your day. Now, on      this day before Mother\\x92s Day, I\\x92ve got to give a special shout-out      to all the moms here.\\xa0 Yay, moms! And I want you to consider      this as a public service announcement for anyone who hasn\\x92t bought      the flowers or the cards or the gifts yet -- all right?\\xa0 I\\x92m trying      to cover you. But remember that one rule is \\x93keep mom      happy.\\x94 All right? And      finally, most of all, I want to congratulate the men and women of      the  Tuskegee University Class of      2015!\\xa0T-U!  Audience:\\xa0 You know!  First Lady Obama:\\xa0 I love that.\\xa0 We      can do that all day. I'm so proud of you all.\\xa0 And you      look good. Well done! You all      have come here from all across the country to study, to learn, maybe      have a little fun along the way -- from freshman year in Adams or      Younge Hall -- to those late night food runs to The Coop. I did my research. To those mornings you woke up early      to get a spot under The Shed to watch the Golden Tigers play. Yeah!\\xa0 I've been watching! At the White House we have      all kinds of ways. And whether      you played sports yourself, or sang in the choir, or played in the      band, or joined a fraternity or sorority -- after today, all of you      will take your spot in the long line of men and women who have come      here and distinguished themselves and this university. You will      follow alums like many of your parents and grandparents, aunts and      uncles -- leaders like      Robert Robinson Taylor, a      groundbreaking architect and administrator here who was recently      honored on a postage stamp. You will follow heroes like     Dr.      Boynton Robinson -- who survived the billy clubs and the      tear gas of      Bloody Sunday in Selma.\\xa0 The story      of Tuskegee is full of stories like theirs -- men and women who came      to this city, seized their own futures, and wound up shaping the arc      of history for African Americans and all Americans. And I\\x92d      like to begin today by reflecting on that history -- starting back      at the time when the Army chose Tuskegee as the site of its airfield      and flight school for black pilots. Back then,      black soldiers faced all kinds of obstacles.\\xa0 There were the      so-called scientific studies that said that black men\\x92s brains were      smaller than white men\\x92s.\\xa0 Official Army reports stated that black      soldiers were \\x93childlike,\\x94 \\x93shiftless,\\x94 \\x93unmoral and untruthful,\\x94      and as one quote stated, \\x93if fed, loyal and compliant.\\x94 So while      the Airmen selected for this program were actually highly educated      -- many already had college degrees and pilots licenses -- they were      presumed to be inferior.\\xa0 During training, they were often assigned      to menial tasks like housekeeping or landscaping.\\xa0 Many suffered      verbal abuse at the hands of their instructors.\\xa0 When they ventured      off base, the white sheriff here in town called them \\x93boy\\x94 and      ticketed them for the most minor offenses.\\xa0 And when they finally      deployed overseas, white soldiers often wouldn\\x92t even return their      salutes. Just think      about what that must have been like for those young men.\\xa0 Here they      were, trained to operate some of the most complicated, high-tech      machines of their day -- flying at hundreds of miles an hour, with      the tips of their wings just six inches apart.\\xa0 Yet when they hit      the ground, folks treated them like they were nobody -- as if their      very existence meant nothing. Now, those      Airmen could easily have let that experience clip their wings.\\xa0 But      as you all know, instead of being defined by the discrimination and      the doubts of those around them, they became one of the most      successful pursuit squadrons in our military. They went      on to show the world that if black folks and white folks could fight      together, and fly together, then surely -- surely -- they could eat      at a lunch counter together.\\xa0 Surely their kids could go to school      together. You see,      those Airmen always understood that they had a \\x93double duty\\x94 -- one      to their country and another to all the black folks who were      counting on them to pave the way forward. So for those      Airmen, the act of flying itself was a symbol of liberation for      themselves and for all African Americans. One of      those first pilots, a man named      Charles DeBow, put it this way.\\xa0 He      said that a takeoff was -- in his words -- \\x93a never-failing miracle\\x94      where all \\x93the bumps would smooth off\\x85 [you\\x92re] in the air\\x85 out of      this world\\x85 free.\\x94 And when he      was up in the sky, Charles sometimes looked down to see black folks      out in the cotton fields not far from here -- the same fields where      decades before, their ancestors as slaves. And he knew that he was      taking to the skies for them -- to give them and their children      something more to hope for, something to aspire to. And in so      many ways, that never-failing miracle -- the constant work to rise      above the bumps in our path to greater freedom for our brothers and      sisters -- that has always been the story of African Americans here      at Tuskegee. Just think      about the arc of this university\\x92s history.\\xa0 Back in the late 1800s,      the school needed a new dormitory, but there was no money to pay for      it.\\xa0 So  Booker T. Washington pawned his      pocket watch to buy a kiln, and students used their bare hands to      make bricks to build that dorm -- and a few other buildings along      the way. A few years      later, when George Washington Carver first came here for his      research, there was no laboratory.\\xa0 So he dug through trash piles      and collected old bottles, and tea cups, and fruit jars to use in      his first experiments. Generation      after generation, students here have shown that same grit, that same      resilience to soar past obstacles and outrages -- past the threat of      countryside lynchings; past the humiliation of Jim Crow; past the      turmoil of the Civil Rights era.\\xa0 And then they went on to become      scientists, engineers, nurses and teachers in communities all across      the country -- and continued to lift others up along the way. And while      the history of this campus isn\\x92t perfect, the defining story of      Tuskegee is the story of rising hopes and fortunes for all African      Americans. And now,      graduates, it\\x92s your turn to take up that cause.\\xa0 And let me tell      you, you should feel so proud of making it to this day.\\xa0 And I hope      that you\\x92re excited to get started on that next chapter.\\xa0 But I also      imagine that you might think about all that history, all those      heroes who came before you -- you might also feel a little pressure,      you know -- pressure to live up to the legacy of those who came      before you; pressure to meet the expectations of others. And believe      me, I understand that kind of pressure.\\xa0 I\\x92ve experienced a little      bit of it myself.\\xa0 You see, graduates, I didn\\x92t start out as the      fully-formed First Lady who stands before you today.\\xa0 No, no, I had      my share of bumps along the way. Back when      my husband first started campaigning for President, folks had all      sorts of questions of me:\\xa0 What kind of First Lady would I be?\\xa0 What      kinds of issues would I take on?\\xa0 Would I be more like Laura Bush,      or Hillary Clinton, or Nancy Reagan?\\xa0 And the truth is, those same      questions would have been posed to any candidate\\x92s spouse.\\xa0 That\\x92s      just the way the process works.\\xa0 But, as potentially the first      African American First Lady, I was also the focus of another set of      questions and speculations; conversations sometimes rooted in the      fears and misperceptions of others.\\xa0 Was I too loud, or too angry,      or too emasculating?\\xa0 Or was I too soft, too much of a mom, not      enough of a career woman? Then there      was the first time I was on a magazine cover -- it was a cartoon      drawing of me with a huge afro and machine gun. Now, yeah, it was      satire, but if I\\x92m really being honest, it knocked me back a bit.\\xa0      It made me wonder, just how are people seeing me. Or you      might remember the on-stage celebratory fist bump between me and my      husband after a primary win that was referred to as a \\x93terrorist      fist jab.\\x94\\xa0 And over the years, folks have used plenty of      interesting words to describe me.\\xa0 One said I exhibited \\x93a little      bit of uppity-ism.\\x93\\xa0 Another noted that I was one of my husband\\x92s      \\x93cronies of color.\\x94\\xa0 Cable news once charmingly referred to me as      \\x93Obama\\x92s Baby Mama.\\x94 And of      course, Barack has endured his fair share of insults and slights.\\xa0      Even today, there are still folks questioning      his citizenship. And all of      this used to really get to me.\\xa0 Back in those days, I had a lot of      sleepless nights, worrying about what people thought of me,      wondering if I might be hurting my husband\\x92s chances of winning his      election, fearing how my girls would feel if they found out what      some people were saying about their mom. But      eventually, I realized that if I wanted to keep my sanity and not      let others define me, there was only one thing I could do, and that      was to have faith in God\\x92s plan for me. I had to ignore      all of the noise and be true to myself -- and the rest would work      itself out. So      throughout this journey, I have learned to block everything out and      focus on my truth.\\xa0 I had to answer some basic questions for      myself:\\xa0 Who am I?\\xa0 No, really, who am I?\\xa0 What do I care about? And the      answers to those questions have resulted in the woman who stands      before you today. A woman who is, first and foremost, a      mom. Look, I love our daughters more than anything in      the world, more than life itself. And while that may not be the      first thing that some folks want to hear from an Ivy-league educated      lawyer, it is truly who I am. So for me, being      Mom-in-Chief is, and always will be, job number one. Next, I\\x92ve      always felt a deep sense of obligation to make the biggest impact      possible with this incredible platform.\\xa0 So I took on issues      that were personal to me -- issues like helping families raise      healthier kids, honoring the incredible military families I\\x92d met on      the campaign trail, inspiring our young people to value their      education and finish college. Now, some      folks criticized my choices for not being bold enough.\\xa0 But these      were my choices, my issues.\\xa0 And I decided to tackle them in the way      that felt most authentic to me -- in a way that was both substantive      and strategic, but also fun and, hopefully, inspiring. So I      immersed myself in the policy details.\\xa0 I worked with Congress on      legislation, gave speeches to CEOs, military generals and Hollywood      executives.\\xa0 But I also worked to ensure that my efforts would      resonate with kids and families -- and that meant doing things in a      creative and unconventional way.\\xa0 So, yeah, I planted a garden, and      hula-hooped on the White House Lawn with kids.\\xa0 I did some Mom      Dancing on TV.\\xa0 I celebrated military kids with Kermit the Frog.\\xa0 I      asked folks across the country to wear their alma mater\\x92s T-shirts      for College Signing Day. And at the      end of the day, by staying true to the me I\\x92ve always known, I found      that this journey has been incredibly freeing.\\xa0 Because no matter      what happened, I had the peace of mind of knowing that all of the      chatter, the name calling, the doubting -- all of it was just noise. It did not define me.\\xa0 It didn\\x92t change who I was.\\xa0 And most      importantly, it couldn\\x92t hold me back.\\xa0 I have learned that as long      as I hold fast to my beliefs and values -- and follow my own moral      compass -- then the only expectations I need to live up to are my      own. So,      graduates, that\\x92s what I want for all of you.\\xa0 I want you all to      stay true to the most real, most sincere, most authentic parts of      yourselves.\\xa0 I want you to ask those basic questions:\\xa0 Who do you      want to be?\\xa0 What inspires you?\\xa0 How do you want to give back?\\xa0 And      then I want you to take a deep breath and trust yourselves to chart      your own course and make your mark on the world. Maybe it      feels like you\\x92re supposed to go to law school -- but what you      really want to do is to teach little kids.\\xa0 Maybe your parents are      expecting you to come back home after you graduate -- but you\\x92re      feeling a pull to travel the world.\\xa0 I want you to listen to those      thoughts.\\xa0 I want you to act with both your mind, but also your      heart.\\xa0 And no matter what path you choose, I want you to make sure      it\\x92s you choosing it, and not someone else. Because      here\\x92s the thing -- the road ahead is not going to be easy.\\xa0 It      never is, especially for folks like you and me.\\xa0 Because while we\\x92ve      come so far, the truth is that those age-old problems are stubborn      and they haven\\x92t fully gone away.\\xa0 So there will be times, just like      for those Airmen, when you feel like folks look right past you, or      they see just a fraction of who you really are. The world      won\\x92t always see you in those caps and gowns.\\xa0 They won\\x92t know how      hard you worked and how much you sacrificed to make it to this day      -- the countless hours you spent studying to get this diploma, the      multiple jobs you worked to pay for school, the times you had to      drive home and take care of your grandma, the evenings you gave up      to volunteer at a food bank or organize a campus fundraiser.\\xa0 They      don't know that part of you. Instead      they will make assumptions about who they think you are based on      their limited notion of the world.\\xa0 And my husband and I know how      frustrating that experience can be.\\xa0 We\\x92ve both felt the sting of      those daily slights throughout our entire lives -- the folks who      crossed the street in fear of their safety; the clerks who kept a      close eye on us in all those department stores; the people at formal      events who assumed we were the \\x93help\\x94\\xa0-- and those who have      questioned our intelligence, our honesty, even our love of this      country. And I know      that these little indignities are obviously nothing compared to what      folks across the country are dealing with every single day -- those      nagging worries that you\\x92re going to get stopped or pulled over for      absolutely no reason; the fear that your job application will be      overlooked because of the way your name sounds; the agony of sending      your kids to schools that may no longer be separate, but are far      from equal; the realization that no matter how far you rise in life,      how hard you work to be a good person, a good parent, a good citizen      -- for some folks, it will never be enough. And all of      that is going to be a heavy burden to carry.\\xa0 It can feel      isolating.\\xa0 It can make you feel like your life somehow doesn\\x92t      matter -- that you\\x92re like the   Invisible Man that Tuskegee      grad  Ralph Ellison wrote about all those      years ago.\\xa0 And as we\\x92ve seen over the past few years, those      feelings are real.\\xa0 They\\x92re rooted in decades of structural      challenges that have made too many folks feel frustrated and      invisible.\\xa0 And those feelings are playing out in communities      like Baltimore and Ferguson and so many others across this country. But,      graduates, today, I want to be very clear that those feelings are      not an excuse to just throw up our hands and give up. Not an excuse.\\xa0 They are not an excuse to lose hope.\\xa0 To succumb to      feelings of despair and anger only means that in the end, we lose. But here\\x92s      the thing -- our history provides us with a better story, a better      blueprint for how we can win.\\xa0 It teaches us that when we pull      ourselves out of those lowest emotional depths, and we channel our      frustrations into studying and organizing and banding together --      then we can build ourselves and our communities up.\\xa0 We can take on      those deep-rooted problems, and together -- together -- we can      overcome anything that stands in our way. And the      first thing we have to do is vote.\\xa0 Hey, no, not just once in a      while.\\xa0 Not just when my husband or somebody you like is on the      ballot.\\xa0 But in every election at every level, all of the time.      Because here is the truth -- if you want to have a say in your      community, if you truly want the power to control your own destiny,      then you\\x92ve got to be involved.\\xa0 You got to be at the table.\\xa0      You\\x92ve got to vote, vote, vote, vote.\\xa0 That\\x92s it; that's the      way we move forward. That\\x92s how we make progress for ourselves and      for our country. That\\x92s      what\\x92s always happened here at Tuskegee.\\xa0 Think about those students      who made bricks with their bare hands.\\xa0 They did it so that others      could follow them and learn on this campus, too.\\xa0 Think about that      brilliant scientist who made his lab from a trash pile.\\xa0 He did it      because he ultimately wanted to help sharecroppers feed their      families.\\xa0 Those Airmen who rose above brutal discrimination -- they      did it so the whole world could see just how high black folks could      soar.\\xa0 That\\x92s the spirit we\\x92ve got to summon to take on the      challenges we face today. And you      don\\x92t have to be President of the United States to start addressing      things like poverty, and education, and lack of opportunity.\\xa0      Graduates, today -- today, you can mentor a young person and make      sure he or she takes the right path.\\xa0 Today, you can volunteer at an      after-school program or food pantry.\\xa0 Today, you can help your      younger cousin fill out her college financial aid form so that she      could be sitting in those chairs one day. But just like      all those folks who came before us, you\\x92ve got to do something to      lay the groundwork for future generations. That pilot      I mentioned earlier -- Charles DeBow -- he didn\\x92t rest on his      laurels after making history.\\xa0 Instead, after he left the Army, he      finished his education.\\xa0 He became a high school English teacher and      a college lecturer.\\xa0 He kept lifting other folks up through      education.\\xa0 He kept fulfilling his \\x93double duty\\x94 long after he hung      up his uniform. And,      graduates, that\\x92s what we need from all of you.\\xa0 We need you to      channel the magic of Tuskegee toward the challenges of today.\\xa0 And      here\\x92s what I really want you to know -- you have got everything you      need to do this.\\xa0 You\\x92ve got it in you. Because even if you\\x92re      nervous or unsure about what path to take in the years ahead, I want      you to realize that you\\x92ve got everything you need right now to      succeed.\\xa0 You\\x92ve got it. You\\x92ve got      the knowledge and the skills honed here on this hallowed campus.\\xa0      You\\x92ve got families up in the stands who will support you every step      of the way.\\xa0 And most of all, you\\x92ve got yourselves -- and all of      the heart, and grit, and smarts that got you to this day. And if you      rise above the noise and the pressures that surround you, if you      stay true to who you are and where you come from, if you have faith      in God\\x92s plan for you, then you will keep fulfilling your duty to      people all across this country.\\xa0 And as the years pass, you\\x92ll feel      the same freedom that Charles DeBow did when he was taking off in      that airplane.\\xa0 You will feel the bumps smooth off.\\xa0 You\\x92ll take      part in that \\x93never-failing miracle\\x94 of progress.\\xa0 And you\\x92ll be      flying through the air, out of this world -- free. God bless      you, graduates. I can\\x92t      wait to see how high you soar. Love you      all.\\xa0 Very proud. Thank you.\"},\n",

       "  'transcript': \" Thank you, Dean Amy      [Jessen-Marshall]. What an honor and      privilege it is to be here today on this hallowed ground speaking to      this class of remarkable women. Many have asked how I      intend to deliver remarks under the circumstances that have brought      us to this place at this moment. I say, as each of you do, too: No      one loved this place more; no one more honors the impact this great      institution has had on countless lives and communities and      professions. Any one of us could do this. Any one of us would do      this for the dignity and eternal grace of      Sweet Briar College. My remarks today will      not be based in nostalgia or in emotionalism. Today we celebrate an      institution which for over one hundred years has empowered women to      lead lifes [sic] of significance: medical professionals, jurists,      entrepreneurs, educators, authors, elected officials, leaders of      every sort. We celebrate you, Class of 2015, perhaps the last      brigade of women Sweet Briar will send out to help change the world.      And I will tell you this: the world is hungry for you -- confident      thinkers, problem solvers, solution makers. If you were in the halls      of Congress, this world would be a better, more functional place. Your liberal arts      education and a nurturing academic environment you have come of age      in makes you particularly able. And with that ability comes the      responsibility to make your mark as the lasting insignia of the      Sweet Briar College legacy. What is so poetic, so      tragically beautiful, is that Sweet Briar, in what some say is her      last aching breaths, is providing you a leadership lesson of a      lifetime. The truth is: Had you been at the table, had you been      called to action, we would not be here today at the proposed end of      an era which is in desperate need of continuance. The reason why is      because you have the asset; you have the antidote our Alma Mater was      looking for. Your greatest asset      right now, other than your superior liberal-arts education, is your      inexperience. You do not know how things \\x93have always been done.\\x94      You are unencumbered by the box of experience and expertise. You      have the agility of mind and the ingenuity that diminishes in us      with each passing year. Sit at any table in life knowing that you      have an asset that cannot easily be replicated by your more senior      colleagues and associates. It will make you bold. Embrace it, and      therein you will find conviction, courage, and faith. The rose you have      earned and will now bear signals to the world that you are original.      This Sweet Briar, single-sex educational experience makes you so.      Your choice of Sweet Briar College tells a fascinating story of      individuality. You do not follow the herd. You are emotionally and      intellectually self-reliant. You take serious things seriously. You      value relationships and experiential learning, something you cannot      get online or in auditoria of mass education. You value logic and      deductive reasoning, sorely underused disciplines today. People are intrigued      by this Sweet Briar experience, and they know immediately that you      are ready and able. It has been the calling card of my life to great      positive effect, and it will be in yours. After concluding my      Sweet Briar educational journey on a day almost exactly like today nearly      30      years ago, I attended  Emory University School of Law in Atlanta.      Now, for those of you that will be attending law school, let me give      you the scoop. Most will tell you to wear a baseball cap to avoid      any kind of eye contact, sit in -- as far in the back as possible, and do not let      the professor notice you. At least that was the protocol for      survival at Emory. I missed that message, however, because I was a      Sweet Briar graduate; and I came to Emory with a love of learning,      and a      confidence in ability, and a willingness to engage. So, I sat on the      front row, bright-eyed, coffee in hand and ready to go. I could not      wait to see my professors\\x92 brilliance on display. Each day I was      bursting with observations from the reading assignment and eager to      hear the observations of my classmates, who, day after day, remained      mute. You could feel the fear in the room. One day I was in my      Civil Procedure class with a curmudgeonly professor. After class I      bounded to the instructor\\x92s well with the youthful enthusiasm of a      22-year-old to ask a burning question. The professor glared at with me      -- at me with disdain and hissed: \\x93Ah, Ms. Pike. I've never met a graduate      of a women\\x92s college that didn\\x92t think she had the most important      thing to say.\\x94 \\x93Awohh, thank you!\\x94 I replied. It was literally hours      later that I stopped mid-step and said: \\x93I think he was trying to insult me.\\x94 And ladies, that is the effect of this      great institution. It takes you in your most formative years; it      instills in you the unquestionable importance of your voice, and it      demonstrates the power of your well-armed, uncompromising mind. You are now programmed      to trust the ingenuity of your inexperience and to revel in it, and      therein you will see solutions no one else sees. You are uniquely      equipped to find the door out of the dark tomb. We could have used      you at the table in these proclaimed last days of our Alma      Mater. Our lot may appear      to be cast -- not by us, but by those we allow to hold the reigns.      But all of us, all schools, all organizations, all enterprises      whatsoever need take heed. A great lesson is afoot. A lesson of      perseverance, courage, righteousness, and effective decision-making. I have a confession to      make: I cannot sing. I cannot draw or paint. I literally have some      sort of impairment that prevents me from learning a foreign      language, as my beloved Sweet Briar French professors, Mr. and Mrs.      Van Treese, will gladly attest. But I can lead. I was double-dipped      in it. For good or bad, that's my gift. It has necessarily meant      that I spend most of my days on the civic battlefield. When those      who need a voice and are not able reach out, I'm there. Those up to no good      somehow always cross my path. Many years ago, I was      involved in some serious litigation of great proportion. No one in      the case was younger than my father. It seemed everyone had gone to      an Ivy League college or law school, and I was a      thirty-something-year-old Sweet Briar-educated lawyer from Columbus,      Georgia who dared to shed a light on things many felt best left in      the dark. By all accounts this case was not going to go well for me.      I knew that. Moments before a critical hearing began, I went to the      only place I could be alone -- the women\\x92s restroom -- and I stared      into the mirror. There, a test of leadership was born, one I use to      this day and I commend to you. I asked:  Am I being      reasonable?  Have I worked as hard as anyone possibly could on      this matter and educated myself to all pertinent information? Have I listened to, thoughtfully considered, and respected contrary      views?  And lastly, are my motives pure? Do I just want the best right thing      to be done, whatever that may be?  What is incredible      about this litany is that it tests the foundation of justifiable      righteousness, and on that basis, I knew I could say something bold      and necessarily controversial. I had been fortified with courage by      the answers to my test. I declared that I would go into the      courtroom and say what others wanted to dance around and avoid. And      I did. People sat slack-jawed as I explained what was going on. The      judge\\x92s attention was transfixed. My worthy adversaries had no reply. One finally uttered, \\x93but, Judge, this isn\\x92t      the way we do things.\\x94 I, though, had convinced the judge that maybe      it was time we did do things this way, and justice was done that      day. Transparency,      candor are fresh, unexpected, and attention getting. People love the      truth. That's what they're seeking daily on the internet and television and social      media. People want the world to make sense. They want to see how the dots      connect; and you can help with that. Dazzle people by giving them      the well-vetted but unvarnished truth upfront. People will believe      in its authenticity, and they will soundly believe in you for      delivering it. After all, when you      are a leader you are merely a conduit of information. You're a      vessel of      action. People confuse that all the time. They wrongly believe that a      leader is the \\x93be all and end all.\\x94 Leadership is not about power;      it's about service, and that service derives from those you are      leading, those who have placed their faith in you -- not some      divine superiority of thought or exclusivity of process. Leaders understand      that solutions come from the most unlikely places. The solution may      come from your perceived \\x93enemy\\x94; it may come from those perceived      to be uninformed; it almost always comes out of nowhere. And that      is why inclusiveness is so important. The larger you make the      conversation, the more impressive the results. Now, there are people      out there thinking: \\x93No way. I am not about to tee up some broad      conversation with a bunch of people I do not know to discuss      possible solutions when I know what the short list of viability is.\\x94 I      understand that sentiment, but you're going to fail as a leader if      you follow it. If your ideas are so good, if your short list so      miraculous, then test it against the critical eye of stakeholders.      If you cannot do that, I suggest you know your motives aren't      pure. You are not looking for the best solution. You're looking for      the solution most comfortable for you. And that, friends, is not      leadership. If you have hidden      your hand, put your finger on the scale, or denied the voice of      others, the result is as illegitimate as the day is long, and you      will certainly lose respect and credibility among those you chose to      exclude or ignore. Invest respect in others, and in good process,      and it will return to you manyfold. Leadership takes      courage, not recklessness. Innate fear is what makes a person in a      leadership position slip into secrecy and insular decision-making.      If such a person can just get the three like-minded thinkers in the      room, they believe they can make all the decisions without the mess      of broad input or, God forbid, controversy. Yet, it's amazing      what you can accomplish when you surrender to the temporary chaos      and controversy of solution-making. There, in all that choppy      water, you find the current to the calm on the other side. If you      hold firm to the justifiable righteousness of your effort, you will      either prevail on the course you have planned, or you will drift to      a better point. Look, Sweet Briar      College is not the only school to have been brought to the brink of      closure. Some have tumbled over, as it appears we have. Others      pulled back and found a new way. Famously, the      Harrow School      for Boys in Britain was once threatened with annihilation. Faced      with the ravages of World War II, the unrelenting bombing of London,      and threats too horrific to imagine, the Harrow School feared it      could be shuttered. The alumni that could be gathered came to pay a      final homage to their beloved Alma Mater. However, ten months later a ray of light appeared.      The Head Master called back its most celebrated alum, the nation\\x92s      Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, to encourage the boys and the      staff forward. There,       Churchill gave these words of encouragement to      the Harrow School -- and I quote:  Another lesson I think      we may take, just throwing our minds back to our meeting here ten      months ago and now, is that appearances are often very deceptive,      and as Kipling well says, we must '\\x85meet with Triumph and Disaster.      And treat those two impostors just the same.' You cannot tell from      appearances how things will go....But for everyone, surely, what we      have gone through in this period -- and I am addressing myself to the      school -- surely from this period of ten months this is the lesson:      Never give in, never give in, never, never, never. In nothing, great      or small, large or petty. Never give in except to convictions of      honor and good sense. Never yield to force; never yield to the      apparently overwhelming might of the enemy. We stood all alone a      year ago, and to many countries it seemed that our account was      closed, we were finished. All this tradition of ours, our songs, our      School history, this part of the history of this country, were gone      and finished and liquidated. Very different is the      mood today. Britain, other nations thought, had drawn a sponge      across her slate. But instead our country stood in the gap. There      was no flinching and no thought of giving in; and by what seemed      almost a miracle to those outside these Islands, though we ourselves      never doubted it, we now find ourselves in a position where I say that we have only to persevere to conquer.1  Now, the situations of      Sweet Briar College and Harrow School for Boys are different, no      doubt: One involved a troublesome debt level (though increasing      assets), a greater than desirable draw on an increasing endowment,      and a several-year decline in student enrollment -- though a dramatic      increase in student applications. The other involved global war,      human decimation, economic collapse, and a struggle beyond all tolerance.      One wants to throw in the towel, the other persevered. Ladies, please know      that giving up is always on the table. Successful leaders, however,      are defined by those that do not choose it. They choose to      persevere. If you can keep a fixed vision of what is possible, you      will never drown in the morass of doubt and defeat. Simply to      persevere is to conquer doubt and defeat. If you join us at the      table, we will persevere. A little over 114      years ago a remarkable woman2 stood right here, and in the discord      and uncertainties of that male-dominated era she saw the      possibilities for a world filled with strong, educated women. We are      born of that vision. We are products of that legacy. And, yet, the false      narratives that women\\x92s colleges are no longer viable, rural      colleges are no longer viable, or that Liberal Arts colleges are no      longer viable were bought into by too many, and contributed to what      threatens to be our Alma Mater\\x92s downfall. The false narratives      permeated and provided comfortable excuses for the inability or      unwillingness to find a path forward. Look at how these false      narratives were ratified by many in the early days of our      announcement -- of the announcement of our impending demise: \\x93Of course,\\x94 some acclaimed.\\xa0      \\x93Women\\x92s colleges are luxuries of the past and have dubious      relevancy.\\x94 Now, we need to admit      something to ourselves. Upon the hearing of the       startling news of the      proposed closure of Sweet Briar College, too many of us hung our      heads for a moment and accepted its defeat. For a split second we,      too, lost faith in the vision bequeathed to us. We temporarily      accepted the doubts of others -- that Sweet Briar wasn\\x92t as strong      as we thought. It wasn\\x92t as valuable as we thought. Sweet Briar      couldn\\x92t cut it in today\\x92s world and at today\\x92s standard. For a      tick of the clock, we hung our heads, and Indiana Fletcher Williams      wept -- until we caught our breath, that is, and realized these are      dangerous false narratives for the sake of excuse and obfuscation.      We are the proof that these narratives are untrue. Nevertheless, this      terrible time, this unnecessary waste has come to pass. The Old Testament      tells us that Queen Esther had come to a particular position in the      kingdom for such a time as this, and Mordecai reminds her that she      need not think her position protects her, for as goes her fate -- as      goes the fate      of those like her, so she will go. So, let me be clear: I have heard      more alarming dog whistles about women who go to women's colleges in      these past two months than I have ever heard in the male-dominated      area of the law I practiced, or in Deep South politics. We should be      troubled by that. When we allow the evidence of the extraordinary      results produced here at Sweet Briar to be diminished and demeaned      by these trite references, so goes all our fates. To all women, and      men who respect women, to everyone who takes the education of women      seriously, whether you cried at the news of the shooting of      Malala      Yousafzai or rejoice when you see       Mika Brzezinski excoriate some      pompous fool on Morning Joe, then you need to know this business      about Sweet Briar's days being done because it's not relevant      anymore is a statement of ignorance and offense. Our fates are tied      to one another, to these young women graduating today, and to the      legacy of Sweet Briar College. And, we should make it our charge to      live our lives in a way that reflects the worthiness of the      college\\x92s mission. In doing so, the extraordinary value of this      education and the burning candles of our lives will continue to cast      unabated a lovely but powerful light. Ladies, we were all      built for each of our lives, but what we share is this incredible place      and learning experience. And I tell you that you are well-equipped      to do anything you desire to do, to accomplish any result, to      compete with the best the country has to offer. Because of the      training you have received at Sweet Briar College, because of your      understanding of respect and relationship, because you are      programmed for endurance, not quick fixes, you are uniquely      equipped to tackle the tough issues and find solutions no one else      sees or has the courage to fathom -- if only you will join us at the      table. This bittersweet day      some come to prematurely mourn our dear Alma Mater, who has served      us well and fulfilled her mission until thwarted from doing so. We      swim in the pride of her legacy and are blessed to have been touched      by it. We are so proud of you, this graduating class of Sweet Briar      College. We charge you today to take all you have learned and      experienced and make the world regret we ever put Sweet Briar      College in jeopardy. Make strangers stop and say: \\x93if only we had      more like her.\\x94 Let us today vow to support women\\x92s education at      every turn so that none fall victim to easy, false narratives of      predestined failure. And to those who have led us to this      regrettable point, let us endeavor to forgive them -- forgive the      lack of transparency, their lack of inclusiveness, the lack of      perseverance, and the failure of faith -- because, truly, they      know not what they've done. As I close, there is a      special leader that I want to thank today. Virginia Attorney General      Mark Herring called me yesterday afternoon and asked me to share two important messages with you. First, he      wanted me to convey his hardy congratulations to the class of 2015      for your accomplishments. Second, he wanted me to tell you that he      will continue to work with those who love Sweet Briar and care about      its legacy and its future in hopes that we can reach the best      possible outcome. Godspeed and best      wishes to you, Class of 2015: Sweet Briar College\\x92s latest, not last      -- latest graduates. Thank you.\"},\n",

       "  'transcript': 'Let me conclude by briefly   sharing with you another generation of young Americans. Sixty years ago this spring   and summer they were beginning to return home to restart their lives after more   than a   dozen years of brutal deprivation, sacrifice, separation, death, and grievous   wounds. Sixty years ago, Nazi Germany and imperial Japan were defeated in a great   war by these young men and women your age and their allies -- in a war that has   been described by the British military historian John Keegan as the greatest   single event in the history of mankind.These young Americans had come   of age in the Great Depression,\\xa0when life was about deprivation and   sharing -- sharing clothing, and shoes, and food, and jobs, and what little   money a family could muster. Children dropped out of school in the eighth grade,   not to buy a 110-dollar pair of sneakers, but to put food on the table, or to   pay for medical care for their mothers and fathers.Ragged bands of hungry men   rode the rails, looking for any kind of work. Families left their dried up   family farms for hard labor in California; city kids slept four to a room in a   walk-up apartment. Banks failed and hope had to be renewed every 24 hours. And   just as these young people, your age and younger, were beginning to emerge from   those dark and difficult days, they were summoned to the great cause of   defeating Nazi Germany and imperial Japan.These young men and their   families answered the call with alacrity. In 1938, America had been the 16th   military power in the world. But overnight, we stopped the production of   civilian vehicles and began the production of tanks, and war planes, and heavy   bombers that were drawn by night and produced by day. Young men went from being   bellhops in Rochester, Minnesota to flying multi-engine bombers in nine months.   City kids went to sea. And everywhere in America everyone joined in by making   one kind of a sacrifice or another.And when they answered that   call, they were forced to fight their way across North Africa, the deadly   beaches of France and Italy, in the freezing winters of central Europe, in the   searing heat of little-known islands across the South Pacific. On all the seas   and all the skies, day in and day out, they fought bloody,\\xa0face-to-face   battles of unspeakable cruelty and death.At home, farmers grew more food and civilians ate less so   the soldiers could be well-fed. Young wives and children didn\\x92t see their husbands   or fathers, or   hear from them, for months at a time, if ever again.  When that great war was over, when the terrible, hateful evils of the Third   Reich and imperial Japan had been defeated, this generation of Americans, your   age, returned to their homes or established new communities. They went to college   in record numbers and they married in record numbers. They gave us new laws   expanding the freedoms of those who had been left behind too long.   They did something that ever [never] been done in the history of warfare. They   rebuilt their enemies. They gave us new art, new science, and new industries.   They gave us great institutions like the one that you enjoy here today. They gave us   no less than the lives that we have in this country now.They did not lay down their arms and say as they could\\x92ve, \\x93I\\x92ve done my share.\\x94   Instead, they came home and became immersed in their communities and their   churches and their schools.

       "  'transcript': \"I want to thank the Mills     College Class of '83 for offering me a rare chance: to speak aloud in     public in the language of women.I know there are men     graduating, and I don't mean to exclude them, far from it. There is a     Greek tragedy where the Greek says to the foreigner, \\x93If you don't     understand Greek, please signify by nodding.\\x94 Anyhow, commencements are     usually operated under the unspoken agreement that everybody graduating     is either male or ought to be. That\\x92s why we are all wearing these     twelfth-century dresses that look so great on men and make women look     either like a mushroom or a pregnant stork.Intellectual tradition is     male. Public speaking is done in the public tongue, the national or     tribal language; and the language of our tribe is the men's language. Of     course women learn it. We're not dumb. If you can tell Margaret Thatcher     from Ronald Reagan, or Indira Gandhi from General Somoza, by anything     they say, tell me how. This is a man\\x92s world, so it talks a man\\x92s     language. The words are all words of power. You\\x92ve come a long way,     baby, but no way is long enough. You can\\x92t even get there by selling     yourself out: because there is theirs, not yours.Maybe we\\x92ve had enough     words of power and talk about the battle of life. Maybe we need some     words of weakness. Instead of saying now that I hope you will all go     forth from this ivory tower of college into the Real World and forge a     triumphant career or at least help your husband to and keep our country     strong and be a success in everything -- instead of talking about power,     what if I talked like a woman right here in public? It won\\x92t sound     right. It\\x92s going to sound terrible. What if I said what I hope for you     is first, if -- only if -- you want kids, I hope you have them. Not     hordes of them. A couple, enough. I hope they\\x92re beautiful. I hope you     and they have enough to eat, and a place to be warm and clean in, and     friends, and work you like doing.Well, is that what you     went to college for? Is that all? What about success?Success is somebody else\\x92s     failure. Success is the American Dream we can keep dreaming because most     people in most places, including thirty million of ourselves, live wide     awake in the terrible reality of poverty. No, I do not wish you success.     I don\\x92t even want to talk about it. I want to talk about failure.Because you are human     beings you are going to meet failure. You are going to meet     disappointment, injustice, betrayal, and irreparable loss. You will find     you\\x92re weak where you thought yourself strong. You\\x92ll work for     possessions and then find they possess you. You will find yourself -- as     I know you already have -- in dark places, alone, and afraid.What I hope for you, for     all my sisters and daughters, brothers and sons, is that you will be     able to live there, in the dark place. To live in the place that our     rationalizing culture of success denies, calling it a place of exile,     uninhabitable, foreign.Well, we\\x92re already     foreigners. Women as women are largely excluded from, alien to, the     self-declared male norms of this society, where human beings are called     Man, the only respectable god is male, the only direction is up. So     that\\x92s their country; let\\x92s explore our own. I\\x92m not talking about sex;     that\\x92s a whole other universe, where every man and woman is on their     own. I\\x92m talking about society, the so-called man\\x92s world of     institutionalized competition, aggression, violence, authority, and     power.If we want to live as     women, some separatism is forced upon us: Mills College is a wise     embodiment of that separatism. The war-games world wasn\\x92t made by us or     for us; we can\\x92t even breathe the air there without masks. And if you     put the mask on you\\x92ll have a hard time getting it off.So how about going on     doing things our own way, as to some extent you did here at Mills? Not     for men and the male power hierarchy -- that\\x92s their game. Not against     men, either -- that\\x92s still playing by their rules. But with any men who     are with us: that\\x92s our game. Why should a free woman with a college     education either fight Machoman or serve him? Why should she live her     life on his terms?Machoman     is afraid of our terms, which are not all rational, positive,     competitive, etc. And so he has taught us to despise and deny them. In     our society, women have lived, and have been despised for living, the     whole side of life that includes and takes responsibility for     helplessness, weakness, and illness, for the irrational and the     irreparable, for all that is obscure, passive, uncontrolled, animal,     unclean -- the valley of the shadow, the deep, the depths of life. All     that the Warrior denies and refuses is left to us and the men who share     it with us and therefore, like us, can\\x92t play doctor, only nurse, can\\x92t     be warriors, only civilians, can\\x92t be chiefs, only indians. Well so that     is our country. The night side of our country. If there is a day side to     it, high sierras, prairies of bright grass, we only know pioneers\\x92 tales     about it, we haven\\x92t got there yet. We\\x92re never going to get there by     imitating Machoman. We are only going to get there by going our own way,     by living there, by living through the night in our own country.So what I hope for you is     that you live there not as prisoners, ashamed of being women, consenting     captives of a psychopathic social system, but as natives. That you will     be at home there, keep house there, be your own mistress, with a room of     your own. That you will do your work there, whatever you\\x92re good at, art     or science or tech or running a company or sweeping under the beds, and     when they tell you that it\\x92s second-class work because a woman is doing     it, I hope you tell them to go to hell and while they\\x92re going to give     you equal pay for equal time. I hope you live without the need to     dominate, and without the need to be dominated. I hope you are never     victims, but I hope you have no power over other people. And when you     fail, and are defeated, and in pain, and in the dark, then I hope you     will remember that darkness is your country, where you live, where no     wars are fought and no wars are won, but where the future is.Our roots are in the dark;     the earth is our country. Why did we look up for blessing -- instead of     around, and down? What hope we have lies there. Not in the sky full of     orbiting spy-eyes and weaponry, but in the earth we have looked down     upon. Not from above, but from below. Not in the light that blinds, but     in the dark that nourishes, where human beings grow human souls.\"}]"

    "            'transcript': \"So I'm standing here in a strange hat and a strange, flowing gown in front of what looks very much like an audience, and I'm about to do something that I don't do very often, which is to make speeches in public. And I'm asking myself how I managed to end up here? This was never in any plan I'd outlined for myself. Nevertheless, I'm here and you're all expecting something coherent, and perhaps meaningful, to come out of my mouth. I'll try, but there are no guarantees. And I have to say I'm a little bit nervous. You might think this is strange for a man who makes his living playing in stadiums, but I often stand in the middle of a stadium full of people and ask myself the same question, how the hell did I end up here? The simple answer is I'm a musician. And for some reason I've never had any other ambition but to be a musician. So by way of explanation, I'll start at the beginning. My earliest memory is also my earliest musical memory. I remember sitting at my mother's feet as she played the piano. She always played tangos for some reason. Perhaps it was the fashion at the time, I don't know. The piano was an upright with worn brass pedals. And when my mother played one of her tangos she seemed to become transported to another world. Her feet rocking rhythmically between the loud and soft pedals, her arms pumping to the odd rhythms of the tango, her eyes intent upon the sheet music in front of her. For my mother, playing the piano was the only time that I wasn't the center of her world—the only time she ignored me. So I knew that something significant—some important ritual—was being enacted here. I suppose I was being initiated into something—initiated into some sort of mystery. The mystery of music. And so I began to aspire to the piano and would spend hours hammering away at atonal clusters in the delusion that if I persisted long enough my noise would become music. I still labor under this delusion My mother cursed me with the fine ear of a musician but the hands of a plumber. Anyway, the piano had to be sold to help us out of a financial hole, and my career as an atonal serialist was mercifully stunted. It wasn't until an uncle of mine emigrated to Canada, leaving behind an old Spanish guitar with five rusty strings that my enormous and clumsy fingers found a musical home, and I found what was to become my best friend. Where the piano had seemed incomprehensible, I was able to make music on the guitar almost instantaneously. Melodies, chords, song structures fell at my fingertips. Somehow I could listen to a song on the radio and then make a passable attempt at playing it. It was a miracle. I spent hour after hour, day after day, month after month, just playing, rejoicing in the miracle and probably driving my parents 'round the bend. But it was their fault in the first place. Music is an addiction, a religion, and a disease. There is no cure. No antidote. I was hooked. There was only one radio station in England at that time—the BBC. And you could hear the Beatles and the Rolling Stones side by side with bits of Mozart, Beethoven, Glenn Miller and even the blues. This was my musical education. Its eclecticism, supplemented by my parents' record collection of Rodgers and Hammerstein , Lerner and Lowe, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, and Jerry Lee Lewis. But it wasn't until the Beatles that I realized that perhaps I could make a living out of music. The Beatles came from the same working-class background as I did. They were English, and Liverpool wasn't any fancier or more romantic than my own home town. And my guitar went from being the companion of my solitude to the means of my escape. There's a lot been written about my life after that time so that I can't remember what's true and what isn't. I had no formal musical education. But I suppose I became successful by a combination of dumb luck, low cunning, and risk-taking born out of curiosity. I still operate in the same way. But your curiosity in music is never entirely satisfied. You could fill libraries with what I don't know about music. There's always something more to learn. Now, musicians aren't particularly good role models in society. We really don't have a very good reputation. Philanderers, alcoholics, addicts, alimony-jumpers, tax-evaders. And I'm not just talking about rock musicians. Classical musicians have just as bad a reputation. And jazz musicians...forget it! But when you watch a musician play—when he enters that private musical world—you often see a child at play, innocent and curious, full of wonder at what can only be adequately described as a mystery—a sacred mystery even. Something deep. Something strange. Both joyous and sad. Something impossible to explain in words. I mean what could possible keep us playing scales and arpeggios hour after hour, day after day, year after year? Is it some vague promise of glory, money, or fame? Or is it something deeper? Our instruments connect us to this mystery and a musician will maintain this sense of wonder 'til the day he or she dies. I had the privilege of spending some time with the great arranger Gil Evans in the last year of his life. He was still listening, still open to new ideas, still open to the wonder of music. Still a curious child. So as we stand here in our robes with our diplomas, our degrees of excellence. Some are merely honorary, some diligently worked for. We have mastered the laws of harmony and the rules of counterpoint, the skills of arranging and orchestrating, of developing themes and rhythmic motifs. But do any of us really know what music is? Is it merely physics? Mathematics? The stuff of romance? Commerce? Why is it so important to us? What is its essence? I can't even pretend to know. I've written hundreds of songs, had them published, had them in the charts. Grammys and enough written proof that I'm a bona fide, successful songwriter. Still, if somebody asks me how I write songs, I have to say, I don't really know. I don't really know where they come from. A melody is always a gift from somewhere else. You just have to learn to be grateful and pray that you will be blessed again some other time. It's the same with the lyrics. You can't write a song without a metaphor. You can mechanically construct verses, choruses, bridges, middle eights, but without a central metaphor, you ain't got nothing. I often wonder: where do melodies and metaphors come from? If you could buy them in a store I'd be first in the queue, believe me. I spend most of my time searching for these mysterious commodities, searching for inspiration. Paradoxically, I'm coming to believe in the importance of silence in music. The power of silence after a phrase of music for example; the dramatic silence after the first four notes of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, or the space between the notes of a Miles Davis solo. There is something very specific about a rest in music. You take your foot off the pedal and pay attention. I'm wondering whether, as musicians, the most important thing we do is merely to provide a frame for silence. I'm wondering if silence itself is perhaps the mystery at the heart of music? And is silence the most perfect music of all? Songwriting is the only form of meditation that I know. And it is only in silence that the gifts of melody and metaphor are offered. To people in the modern world, true silence is something we rarely experience. It is almost as if we conspire to avoid it. Three minutes of silence seems like a very long time. It forces us to pay attention to ideas and emotions that we rarely make any time for. There are some people who find this awkward, or even frightening. Silence if disturbing. It is disturbing because it is the wavelength of the soul. If we leave no space in our music—and I'm as guilty as anyone else in this regard—then we rob the sound we make of a defining context. It is often music born from anxiety to create more anxiety. It's as if we're afraid of leaving space. Great music's as much about the space between the notes as it is about the notes themselves. A bar's rest is as important and significant as the bar of demi-, semi-quavers that precedes it. What I'm trying to say here is that if ever I'm asked if I'm religious I always reply, Yes, I'm a devout musician. Music puts me in touch with something beyond the intellect, something otherworldly, something sacred. How is it that some music can move us to tears? Why is some music indescribably beautiful? I never tire of hearing Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings or Faures Pavane or Otis Redding's Dock of the Bay. These pieces speak to me in the only religious language I understand. They induce in me a state of deep meditation, of wonder. They make me silent. It's very hard to talk about music in words. Words are superfluous to the abstract power of music. We can fashion words into poetry so that they are understood the way music is understood, but they only aspire to the condition where music already exists. Music is probably the oldest religious rite. Our ancestors used melody and rhythm to co-opt the spirit world to their purposes—to try and make sense of the universe. The first priests were probably musicians. The first prayers probably songs. So what I'm getting round to saying is that as musicians, whether we're successful, playing to thousands of people every night, or not so successful, playing in bars or small clubs, or not successful at all, just playing alone in your apartment to the cat, we are doing something that can heal souls, that can mend us when our spirits are broken. Whether you make a million dollars or not one cent, music and silence are priceless gifts, may you always possess them. May they always possess you. So I'm standing here in a strange hat and a strange, flowing gown in front of what looks very much like an audience, and I'm about to do something that I don't do very often, which is to make speeches in public. And I'm asking myself how I managed to end up here? This was never in any plan I'd outlined for myself.

    "         'transcript': \"Ladies and gentlemen of the graduating class of 1995, President Berk, assembled faculty, family members, well-wishers and hangers-on, congratulations! I feel deeply honored to be with you here today and in such distinguished company. It's a beautiful day and it was a lovely performance last night; very moving and wonderful to feel included in it. I get the feeling that people all over the country are graduating and they're leaving one phase and moving on to another with a combined feeling of anxiety and elation. I feel it too; as we approach the millennium the world itself is in a state of profound transition. And, in these times and on this day, there's bound to be a lot of talk about music as a career, music as an industry and the entertainment business. And that's fine. But I want to talk about music as spiritual food. I applaud and admire your decision to make music the focus and the center of your lives, because in spite of the increasing presence of corporate priorities in music today, it is not a safe career choice to become a musician. There are risks involved, and I think it's important to remember why we take those risks. My wife Katherine refers to this period of time that we're in now as high late capitalism, and I agree with her that it's characterized by a general, ongoing attempt to put a dollar value on pretty much everything. In fact, as a culture we seem to feel uneasy and skeptical about anything that doesn't have a number attached to it that represents money in the bank. I would just like to make one simple and obvious point that was clear to me when I started out, but that has become more obscure as I've repeatedly taken myself to market. And that's simply that it's a gift. It's a blessing, and we really are the lucky ones to have music in our lives and at the center of things. Because as you know, music is the true soul food, and not that other stuff. You can criticize it, you can put a spin on it, you can analyze it and interpret it in terms of its cultural significance. But, basically that doesn't affect music. Music is beyond the fashion of consensus reality, and basically, it either connects with us, or it doesn't. And because it follows the laws of the physical universe, it reminds us of the truth that lies beneath and beyond the illusion that we live in. It gives us relief from the insanity of constantly trying to invent ourselves. And in this way, music is true spiritual practice. I thank God for music, and I thank music for God. So, render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's, but keep the moneychangers out of the temple, and keep music to yourself. I would advise you to keep your overhead down; avoid a major drug habit; play every day; and take it in front of other people—they need to hear it, and you need them to hear it . And persevere. The Japanese say, fall down seven times, and stand up eight times. So, remember why you chose this risky enterprise. Well, Class of ´95, carry on.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"I am very glad that Miss Adams made it clear that what I am speaking for today is all of us—the 400 of us—and I find myself in a familiar position, that of reacting, something that our generation has been doing for quite a while now. We're not in the positions yet of leadership and power, but we do have that indispensable element of criticizing and constructive protest and I find myself reacting just briefly to some of the things that Senator Brooke said. This has to be quick because I do have a little speech to give. Part of the problem with just empathy with professed goals is that empathy doesn't do us anything. We've had lots of empathy; we've had lots of sympathy, but we feel that for too long our leaders have viewed politics as the art of the possible. And the challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible. What does it mean to hear that 13.3 percent of the people in this country are below the poverty line? That's a percentage. We're not interested in social reconstruction; it's human reconstruction. How can we talk about percentages and trends? The complexities are not lost in our analyses, but perhaps they're just put into what we consider a more human and eventually a more progressive perspective. The question about possible and impossible was one that we brought with us to Wellesley four years ago. We arrived not yet knowing what was not possible. Consequently, we expected a lot. Our attitudes are easily understood having grown up, having come to consciousness in the first five years of this decade—years dominated by men with dreams, men in the civil rights movement, the Peace Corps, the space program—so we arrived at Wellesley and we found, as all of us have found, that there was a gap between expectation and realities. But it wasn't a discouraging gap and it didn't turn us into cynical, bitter old women at the age of 18. It just inspired us to do something about that gap. What we did is often difficult for some people to understand. They ask us quite often: Why, if you're dissatisfied, do you stay in a place? Well, if you didn't care a lot about it you wouldn't stay. It's almost as though my mother used to say, You know I'll always love you but there are times when I certainly won't like you. Our love for this place, this particular place, Wellesley College, coupled with our freedom from the burden of an inauthentic reality allowed us to question basic assumptions underlying our education. Before the days of the media orchestrated demonstrations, we had our own gathering over in Founder's parking lot. We protested against the rigid academic distribution requirement. We worked for a pass-fail system. We worked for a say in some of the process of academic decision making. And luckily we were at a place where, when we questioned the meaning of a liberal arts education there were people with enough imagination to respond to that questioning. So we have made progress. We have achieved some of the things that we initially saw as lacking in that gap between expectation and reality. Our concerns were not, of course, solely academic as all of us know. We worried about inside Wellesley questions of admissions, the kind of people that were coming to Wellesley, the kind of people that should be coming to Wellesley, the process for getting them here. We questioned about what responsibility we should have both for our lives as individuals and for our lives as members of a collective group. Coupled with our concerns for the Wellesley inside here in the community were our concerns for what happened beyond Hathaway House. We wanted to know what relationship Wellesley was going to have to the outer world. We were lucky in that Miss Adams, one of the first things she did was set up a cross-registration with MIT because everyone knows that education just can't have any parochial bounds anymore. One of the other things that we did was the Upward Bound program. There are so many other things that we could talk about; so many attempts to kind of - at least the way we saw it - pull ourselves into the world outside. And I think we've succeeded. There will be an Upward Bound program, just for one example, on the campus this summer. Many of the issues that I've mentioned—those of sharing power and responsibility, those of assuming power and responsibility—have been general concerns on campuses throughout the world. But underlying those concerns there is a theme, a theme which is so trite and so old because the words are so familiar. It talks about integrity and trust and respect. Words have a funny way of trapping our minds on the way to our tongues but there are necessary means even in this multimedia age for attempting to come to grasps with some of the inarticulate maybe even inarticulable things that we're feeling. We are, all of us, exploring a world that none of us even understands and attempting to create within that uncertainty. But there are some things we feel, feelings that our prevailing, acquisitive, and competitive corporate life, including tragically the universities, is not the way of life for us. We're searching for more immediate, ecstatic, and penetrating modes of living. And so our questions, our questions about our institutions, about our colleges, about our churches, about our government continue. The questions about those institutions are familiar to all of us. We have seen them heralded across the newspapers. Senator Brooke has suggested some of them this morning. But along with using these words—integrity, trust, and respect—in regard to institutions and leaders, we're perhaps harshest with them in regard to ourselves. Every protest, every dissent, whether it's an individual academic paper or Founder's parking lot demonstration, is unabashedly an attempt to forge an identity in this particular age. That attempt at forging for many of us over the past four years has meant coming to terms with our humanness. Within the context of a society that we perceive—now we can talk about reality, and I would like to talk about reality sometime, authentic reality, inauthentic reality, and what we have to accept of what we see—but our perception of it is that it hovers often between the possibility of disaster and the potentiality for imaginatively responding to men's needs. There's a very strange conservative strain that goes through a lot of New Left, collegiate protests that I find very intriguing because it harkens back to a lot of the old virtues, to the fulfillment of original ideas. And it's also a very unique American experience. It's such a great adventure. If the experiment in human living doesn't work in this country, in this age, it's not going to work anywhere. But we also know that to be educated, the goal of it must be human liberation. A liberation enabling each of us to fulfill our capacity so as to be free to create within and around ourselves. To be educated to freedom must be evidenced in action, and here again is where we ask ourselves, as we have asked our parents and our teachers, questions about integrity, trust, and respect. Those three words mean different things to all of us. Some of the things they can mean, for instance: Integrity, the courage to be whole, to try to mold an entire person in this particular context, living in relation to one another in the full poetry of existence. If the only tool we have ultimately to use is our lives, so we use it in the way we can by choosing a way to live that will demonstrate the way we feel and the way we know. Integrity—a man like Paul Santmire. Trust. This is one word that when I asked the class at our rehearsal what it was they wanted me to say for them, everyone came up to me and said Talk about trust, talk about the lack of trust both for us and the way we feel about others. Talk about the trust bust. What can you say about it? What can you say about a feeling that permeates a generation and that perhaps is not even understood by those who are distrusted? All we can do is keep trying again and again and again. There's that wonderful line in East Coker by Eliot about there's only the trying, again and again and again; to win again what we've lost before. And then respect. There's that mutuality of respect between people where you don't see people as percentage points. Where you don't manipulate people. Where you're not interested in social engineering for people. The struggle for an integrated life existing in an atmosphere of communal trust and respect is one with desperately important political and social consequences. And the word consequences of course catapults us into the future. One of the most tragic things that happened yesterday, a beautiful day, was that I was talking to a woman who said that she wouldn't want to be me for anything in the world. She wouldn't want to live today and look ahead to what it is she sees because she's afraid. Fear is always with us but we just don't have time for it. Not now. There are two people that I would like to thank before concluding. That's Eldie Acheson, who is the spearhead for this, and also Nancy Scheibner who wrote this poem which is the last thing that I would like to read: My entrance into the world of so-called social problems Must be with quiet laughter, or not at all. The hollow men of anger and bitterness The bountiful ladies of righteous degradation All must be left to a bygone age. And the purpose of history is to provide a receptacle For all those myths and oddments Which oddly we have acquired And from which we would become unburdened To create a newer world To translate the future into the past. We have no need of false revolutions In a world where categories tend to tyrannize our minds And hang our wills up on narrow pegs. It is well at every given moment to seek the limits in our lives. And once those limits are understood To understand that limitations no longer exist. Earth could be fair. And you and I must be free Not to save the world in a glorious crusade Not to kill ourselves with a nameless gnawing pain But to practice with all the skill of our being The art of making possible. Thanks.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"This is my first commencement, and I think it’s a wonderful college to be having it. I liked hearing a woman chaplain give in invocation; I admire your distinguished and extraordinary President; and I agree heartily with the content of the two speeches, especially their upfront feminist sentiments, just delivered by two graduating seniors… Graduation is one of the few genuine rites of passage left in our society. You are, individually and collectively, passing symbolically from one place to another, from an old to a new status. And, like all such rites, it is both retrospective and prospective. You are graduating (or being graduated) from college, which is the end of something. But the ceremony we are participating in is called commencement. That necessarily seasonal, minor literary form called the “commencement address” also faces in two directions. It usually starts with an analysis of the society or the era—appropriately pessimistic. It generally concludes with a heavy dose of exhortation, in which the young graduates, after having been suitably alarmed, are nevertheless urged to be of good cheer as they go forth into the arena of struggle that is your life, and this world. As a writer, therefore fascinated by genres, as well as an American, and therefore prone to sermonizing, I shall respect the tradition. The times we live in are indeed alarming. It is a time of the most appalling escalation of violence—violence to the environment, both “nature” and “culture;” violence to all living beings. A time in which an ideology of exterminism, institutionalized in the nuclear arms race, has gained increasing credence—threatening life itself. It is also a time of a vertiginous drop in cultural standards, of virulent anti-intellectualism, and of triumphant mediocrity—a mediocrity that characterizes the educational system that you have just passed through, or has passed you through (for all the efforts and good will of many of your teachers). Trivializing standards, using as their justification the ideal of democracy, have made the very idea of a serious humanist education virtually unintelligible to most people. A vast system of mental lobotomization has been put into operation that sets the standards to which all accede. (I am speaking, of course, of American television.) A singularly foolish and incompetent president sets the tone for an extraordinary regression in public ideals, strengthening apathy and a sense of hopelessness before the self-destructive course of foreign policy and the arms race. The best critical impulses in our society—such as that which has give rise to feminist consciousness—are under vicious attack. An increasing propaganda for conformism in morals and in art instructs us that originality and individuality will always be defeated, and simply do not pay. There is a strengthening of the power of censors within and without. The constraints which govern us in this society have little in common with the grim normalcy of totalitarian societies. Our society does not censor as totalitarian societies do; on the contrary, our society promises liberty, self-fulfillment, and self-expression. But many features of our so-called culture have as their goal and result the reduction of our mental life, or our mental operation; and this is precisely, I would argue, what censorship is about. Censorship does not exist in order to keep secrets. The secrets that censors target, such as sex, are usually open secrets. Censorship is a formal principle. It has no predetermined subject. It exists in order to promote and defend power against the challenge of individuality. It exists in order to maintain optimism, to suppress pessimism; that is to give pessimism—which often means truthfulness—a bad conscience. Of course, the grim assessments of our era—such as I have just outlined—can themselves become a species of conformity. But only if we have too simple a sense of our lives. Whenever we speak, we tend to make matters sound simpler than they are, and than we know they are. I have said that this rite of passage—commencement—is one that faces in two directions. Your old status and your new status. The past and the present. The present and the future. But I would urge that it is not just a description of today’s exercises but a model for how you should try to live. As if you were always graduating, ending, and, simultaneously, always beginning. And your sense of the world, and of the large amount of life before you, also should face in two directions. It is true that the macro-news—the news about the world—is bad. It is also true that your news may not be bad; indeed, that you have a duty not to let it be as bad for you. Perhaps the main point of knowing a rule is to be an exception to it. If your liberal arts education has meant anything, it has given you some notions of a critical opposition to the way things are (and are generally defined—for example, for you as women.) This attitude of opposition is not justified as a strategy, as a means to an end, a way of changing the world. It is, rather, the best way of being in the world. As individuals we are never outside of some system which bestows significance. But we can become aware that our lives consist: both really and potentially, of many systems. That we always have choices, options—and that it is a failure of imagination (or fantasy) not to perceive this. The large system of significance in which we live is called “culture.” In that sense, no one is without a culture. But in a stricter sense, culture is not a given but an achievement, that we have to work at all our lives. Far from being given, culture is something we have to strive to protect against all incursions. Culture is the opposite of provinciality—the provinciality of the intellect, and the provinciality of the heart. (Far from being merely national, or local, it is properly international.) The highest culture is self-critical and makes us suspicious and critical of state power. The liberal arts education you have received is not a luxury, as some of you may think, but a necessity- and more. For there is an intrinsic connection between a liberal arts education, by which I mean an education in the traditions and methods of “high” culture, and the very existence of liberty. Liberty means the right to diversity, to difference; the right to difficulty. It is the study of history and philosophy- it’s the love of arts, in all the non-linear complexity of their traditions- that teaches us that. Perhaps the most useful suggestion I can make on the day when most of you are ceasing to be students, is that you go on being students- for the rest of your lives. Don’t move to a mental slum. If you go on being students, if you do not consider you have graduated and that your schooling is done, perhaps you can at least save yourselves and thereby make a space for others, in which they too can resist the pressures to conformity, the public drone and the inner and outer censors- such as those who tell you that you belong to a “post-feminist generation.” There are other counsels that might be useful. But if I had to restrict myself to just one, I would want to praise the virtue of obstinacy. (This is something anyone who is a writer knows a good deal about: for without obstinacy, or stubbornness, or tenacity, or pigheadedness, nothing gets written.) For whatever you want to do, if it has any quality or distinction or creativity- or, as women, if it defies sexual stereotypes- you can be sure that most people and many institutions will be devoted to encouraging you not to do it. If you want to do creative work- if you want, even though women, to lead unservile lives- there will be many obstacles. And you will have many excuses. These do not mitigate the failure. “Whatever prevents you from doing your work,” a writer once observed, “has become your work.” All counsels of courage usually contain, at the end, a counsel of prudence. In Spenser’s The Faerie Queen, Book III, there is a place called the Castle of Busyrane, on whose outer gate is written BE BOLD, and on the second gate, BE BOLD, BE BOLD, and on the inner iron door, BE NOT TOO BOLD. This is not the advice I am giving. I would urge you to be as imprudent as you dare. BE BOLD, BE BOLD, BE BOLD. Keep on reading. (Poetry. And novels from 1700 to 1940.) Lay off the television. And, remember when you hear yourself saying one day that you don’t have time any more to read- or listen to music, or look at painting, or go to the movies, or do whatever feeds you head now- then you’re getting old. That means they got to you, after all. I wish you Love. Courage. And Fantasy.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"Thank you, Dr. Keohane for that kind introduction I am very glad to be here in Wellesley this morning. I must say, it is wonderful to be in a place that already has a woman President. I understand that when Wellesley was founded, one fellow objected that “vigorous study will prove too strenuous for the feminine mind and condition.” I just want you to know I ran into a few of his relatives and they didn’t think a woman could run for a national office, and I’m glad you and I have proven him wrong. But what makes me happy, as I look out from the podium today, is knowing that I’m not just looking at a graduating class, I’m looking at part of a return on my generation’s investment in the future. You, like thousands of other graduates throughout the country, are the most valuable resource our nation has. Your years at Wellesley have given you a voice in our future, and equipped you for the tasks our nation will face in the years to come. The liberal arts training that you have received is probably the single most important tool our nation can have to help us face tomorrow. You have acquired the ability to think. You have learned to analyze and research. You have learned to separate fact from fiction, to gather data and understand what it tells you. You have met the thinkers who have built our history and our culture. You have learned, not just to make a living, but to make a life. But I hope that’s not all Wellesley gave you. I hope it gave you the vision to see beyond yourselves; that sometime in these past four years, somewhere between meeting your first Ask-Me and sitting down to the champagne breakfast, you have taken the time to ask the larger questions. I am confident that Wellesley has taught you to see yourselves as part of a larger community. Not just as women, or as Americans, but as global citizens. If our country is to survive, we can no longer stand isolated. Today we are entirely interdependent on other nation’s well being. This is true economically, scientifically, and culturally. This means new directions for all us all, and new doors opening up. Those of you graduating today have been raised as members in a global family. In the next years, you will have more knowledge of, and more contact with, people in other nations than any generation in history. Your lives will be richer for that. That contact will bring you economic and scientific progress, and exciting cultural discoveries. It also brings new responsibilities. To be concerned not just about ourselves, but about each other. The problems that will face us tomorrow demand solutions that transcend our borders and national interests. We need a long-range perspective, one that looks beyond what will solve today’s crisis to what will build tomorrow’s society. Nowhere is this wider view more important than in our nation’s foreign policy. I recently returned from a three-week trip to Europe, where I met with several heads of state. I spoke in detail with defense and finance ministers and foreign secretaries of our NATO allies. Today want to share with you some of what I found on that trip. We are a strong coalition because we hold strong principles, NATO began as a union to build and defend the values that our countries hold in common. Together, we support the ideal of a participatory democracy. We believe in the free competition of ideas. Above all, we have a firm commitment to human rights. Of course we have disagreements. Those I talked with stressed that the United States must work to maintain a partnership of equals. They pointed out that being friends means we must ask before we act. They are unhappy when we move unilaterally, when we impose sanctions without consulting them, as President Reagan recently did in Nicaragua. Only by cooperating fully can we get their help for programs we all need. They expect to be partners in fact, not after it – and they are right. As I look to our future as global citizens, I am most concerned about our relationship with the Soviet Union, the issue I considered most important in my campaign. We must have no illusions in dealing with them. They are our chief adversary. Their totalitarian system is based on values which are repugnant to us as a free nation. But I remember reading in the papers an interchange that occurred between a Western reporter and a Czechoslovakian farmer after Russians invaded that country. The reporter asked if the Czech viewed the Soviets as friends or brothers. The farmer didn’t hesitate: “Brothers, of course. You choose your friends.” We are today in the same position as that farmer. We do not like what the Soviets stand for, and we are opposed to much of what they do. But we do share a globe with them. In the years to come, our challenge is to find areas of common concern, where we can work together to build bridges between our nations. We must learn to cooperate where we can, and compete where we must: in the free flow of ideas and the realm of human rights. I know we can do better. Last month, President Reagan went on a trip to Europe to mark the 40th anniversary of the end of World War II. His visit to Bitburg was a sorry and insensitive slight to all of us who recognize the horrors of that terrible war. But instead of going to that dark cemetery, he might have used the opportunity to mark another anniversary. Forty years ago last month, Russian and American soldiers met and shook hands at the River Elbe. It was a dramatic image of those weary men greeting each other. But it also marked the end of our last great alliance with the Russians. We missed that anniversary, and we missed, too, a chance to send the Soviets a positive signal that we want to work at improving relations with their country. The Soviets are not like us, but neither are they ten feet tall. Our future demands more than the will to stand up to the Soviets: it also demands the wisdom to sit down with them as well. The next few months will mark a crossroads in US-Soviet relations. Chairman Gorbachev is clearly consolidating his power. He has postponed the Communist Party Congress until February, which gives him time to marshal his forces still further. He will have an opportunity to name additional members to the Politburo and change fully one-third of the members of the Central Committee. Those signals are clear: the Soviet leadership is now in the process of drawing up a blueprint which will last five, ten, or fifteen years. That is the program that will affect us in the years ahead and we must act now to shape that policy. Again, we must look beyond ourselves, beyond our time, into the future. We must work with each other now, or risk confrontation later. We need that long-range view in our dealings with all nations. Too often, we have found ourselves in a position of having to react – simply because we didn’t hold a vision of the future. The time has come to ally ourselves, not with the powers of repression, as we have done in so many parts of the globe, but with the ideal of liberation and empowerment. It is our duty to become involved in human rights wherever they are being violated. As Americans, we have something in common with people everywhere who seek a greater voice in shaping their lives. Americans have always believed in the principle that nations are better off when their people are free. Those are the roots of our country, and it is what we have always stood for. Freedom has been the central theme of our great struggle to become a nation. We must apply that standard throughout the world, whether we are dealing with our adversaries like the Soviet Union or nations we call friends, like the Philippines. America’s voice must be heard calling for human rights wherever people are oppressed, in Chile, in Haiti, in Ireland, in Cuba and in South Africa. We have a moral obligation to speak out. American students have made their voices heard very clearly on this issue. It is tremendously impressive to see young people speaking out at universities across the country. I spoke at Hunter College in New York two days ago, where I met their student body president. It was a young woman who spearheaded the successful effort to make the entire City University of New York system divest its South African holdings. We have seen such actions at Yale, at Columbia, and here at Wellesley. I congratulate those of you here at Wellesley who successfully worked with your Committee for Social Responsibility to urge divestment in companies who refuse to abide by the Sullivan principles, and I thank you for wearing those white armbands today. This is global citizenry at work. When we expand our actions beyond our own concerns, we do more than just focus attention on the problem. People get involved. They learned that when we raise our voices together, we are heard. Our moral convictions inspire us to speak out, but it is also in our national interest to do so. The United States cannot ally itself with powers of repression in South Africa; it is clear that the majority rule will come into that country. We cannot interfere with the self-governance of our Central American neighbors; it is clear they will take their own road to development. Nor can we stay silent when there are prisoners of conscience in jails in the Soviet Union, for it is clear that some day their voices will be heard. As we look for new opportunities in that direction, let me make a suggestion. We will soon have a perfect opportunity to stand up for these principles. This summer marks the 10-year anniversary of the signing of the Helsinki Accords. Those accords were a landmark stand in our fight for human rights in the Soviet bloc countries. Let’s not miss that anniversary. Let us use it to reaffirm what American has always stood for: the right of all people to be free. That is the path of our future. There are new opportunities, too, for human rights in our own country, and that was the message of our campaign. We did not win the election, but we did win something very important: a victory of spirit that will help our country face the future. We broke down an unjust and unwise barrier. The night he chose me, Walter Mondale opened up a door that will never again be closed. By putting a woman on the national ticket, we declared that the tyranny of expectations is over. My campaign was part of a larger shift in our society, one landmark in an age of important landmarks for women. Now we have had the first woman in space, the first woman on the United States Supreme Court, the first women on the national ticket of a major party, the first woman ever to win the 18-day dog sled race in Alaska, and just last month the first woman to be ordained as a conservative rabbi. Not to mention the first women’s rowing crew in the nation, right here at Wellesley. Why this breaking of barriers everywhere at once? Because, in my opinion, there is so much unfortunate history to break with and repudiate – a history of unequal treatment and low expectations for women. When I was about to go to college, my uncle said to my mother: “Don’t bother, Antonetta, she’s pretty, she’ll get married.” Well, I was…and I did. I am only sorry that he didn’t live to see that niece nominated for the second highest office in the land. When I applied to law school, a university official asked if I was “serious” – because, after all, I was taking a man’s place. Today, no professor would be caught dead saying that to a female student. First of all, that professor could be a woman. In fact, if she were at Wellesley, you can bet her Department Chair would be a woman. More important, the greatest achievement of the woman’s movement has been to transform our expectations. Today, in America, women can be whatever we want to be. We can walk in space, and help our children take their first steps. We can run a corporation and work as wives and mothers. We can be doctors and we can teach our six-year-old children how to bake cookies. Or we can choose none of these. We don’t have to be superwomen. For the first 14 years of my marriage, I worked at home as a mother and wife. That was a fine profession, and nothing I have done since has filled me with more pride and satisfaction. For me, it was the right thing. Then I decided to work outside the home, and that was also the right decision for me. Not every woman would agree with my decisions, but the point is, they were mine – I made them for myself. I know that every woman can take pride in whatever she chooses to do. No school understands better than this one. For more than a century, you have made history for women. For a decade, your Center for Research on Women has been doing fine work in areas like education, employment, and minorities. Only twelve years ago, there was no law guaranteeing a woman’s right to compete in school athletics. This fall, Wellesley will dedicate its own spectacular women’s sports complex. Even the most sacred Wellesley traditions reflect the new options open to women: I understand Hoop Rolling now helps your career, not just your marital status. That freedom isn’t just good news for women, it’s good news for all Americans. I believe that a nation can only be great by using all of the talents and all of the energy of all of its citizens. I’m not speaking just to women today. You don’t have to be women to be a woman to be offended by discrimination. Most men are. Every father is diminished when his daughter is denied a fair chance. Every son is a victim when his mother is denied fair pay. The fact is that when we lower barriers, when we open doors, we free all of us to reach wherever our dreams will take us. Let me share a letter I received from a Rhode Island woman with two young daughters, aged four and two. “I brought my two daughters to a rally in Providence, because I wanted them to see you. I wanted them to know what they could aspire to, that the possibilities for them were limitless, that they could, if they wanted, be President, and that being female would not preclude them from doing or being any they chose.” That was really what our campaign was all about – making America the best it can be by using the talents of every American. And that is why, whatever else happened in 1984, I will never regret the campaign. It was a gain, not just for women – it was a plus for all Americans. We took down that sign that said “Men Only” on the door to the White House. That was more than just and idea for 1984 – that was an ideal to carry us to the year 2000 and beyond. I spoke in Seattle two weeks ago, in a room packed with 1150 women. Afterwards, a young girl spoke up. She said: “I’m 17 years old, and when I hear you list women’s accomplishments in the last few years, I just wonder what will still be left for my generation to do?” (In response to a laugh from the audience, Ferraro then extemporized a remark to the effect that it was a good thing no conservatives were present because the audience’s reaction would have upset them.) To me, that question symbolized where we are as women in 1985: we’ve made enough progress so that young women take so many things for granted. The fact that any 17-year old can honestly look around her life and wonder “what’s left” is a tribute to a lot of hard work. But we can’t stop there. We must continue those strides, broadening our horizons and our hopes. I remind you of what I reminded her: The good is the enemy of the better, and still greater enemy of the best. We talked for a few minutes about Equal Rights Amendment, and about comparable pay and pay equity, and all the other vital issues facing us as women in 1985. I think, when we finished, she was relieved to find that her generation just might have one or two battles left to fight. And that is my message to you today. You are free to rise as high as your dreams will take you. Your task is to build the future of this country and of our world. You are our new global citizens. Whatever you do, I remind each of you that your potential and possibilities at this juncture of your lives are absolutely limitless. Wellesley has given you the skills to make this world a better place. It has offered you the vision to make it more human. For my part, I wish you the courage to stand up for what you believe in. I know there are new doors ahead for our country, and I hope we’ll go through them together. With your help, I look forward to seeing what lies beyond them. Congratulations and good luck.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"I am honored to share this day with all of the Class of 1988, and I will always remember it. On the other hand, you may not remember it at all. To insert a note of realism here, I don't remember one single thing about my commencement speaker, or what she said, or what he said. Instead of one theme that might exclude many people, I'm going to be diverse in the hope of coming up with a sentence or two that might be more useful to more people. Each thought will be brief, but all have the same inspiration, the daring examples of the founders of this college. Pauline Adeline Fowle Durant and Henry Fowle Durant who once walked this land as their home, and who supervised every brick of its first buildings with idealism and with love. I call them daring examples, because they were. In the 1860s when the Durants decided to begin this college, the popular wisdom in America was that educating women was foolish at best, since their natural calling of marriage and childbearing would prevent them from using that education. And it was dangerous at worst, since many physicians believed that blood sent to the female brain in “unnatural” intellectual activity would deprive female reproductive organs. Among the dangers of education women were feared to be both sterility and insanity. As one Boston physician of the era warned, “a woman’s brain is too delicate and fragile a thing to attempt the mastery of Greek and Latin.” As another said, “There will be two insane asylums and three hospitals for every women’s college.” We must also remember that females were not then legally defined as citizens, or even autonomous human beings- nor were they until a half century later. Then they were simply chattel, the legal possessions first of their fathers, then of their husbands. If they were disobedient, they could be legally beaten with a rod the size of a thumb- from which comes the term “rule of thumb”. If they ran away from battering husbands or incestuous fathers, they could be legally and forcibly returned. Susan B. Anthony and other suffragists gave shelter to runaway slaves, for which they got a little support, but also runaway wives who were escaping violent husbands, or daughters escaping incestuous fathers. For that, they got even less. That, they were told, was “going too far.” It was this sort of atmosphere that Henry Durant had the courage, and the radicalism, and the compassion, and the chutzpah, to say: “The Higher Education of Women is one of the great world battle cries for freedom, for right against might.” He advocated preparing women “for great conflicts, for vast reforms in social life, for noblest usefulness” It’s probably symptomatic of the time that, though he and his wife worked together in this cause, I could find no quotes directly from Pauline. So it seems to me that you and I have an obligation. We have an obligation to be at least as visionary and radical in the context of 1988 as Henry and Pauline were when this college opened in 1875. We will spend our lives elaborating many profound changes and many ideas, but here is my list of a few suggestions. IDEA #1 That men care for infants as much as women do. I’m sure that you have figured out by now that for women, having it all means doing it all. The Superwoman Syndrome is not a creation of the Women’s Movement. It’s a creation of the adversaries of the Women’s Movement. Their first stage of resistance was: “No, you can’t be a doctor, or an engineer, or a carpenter,” or whatever you wanted to be. Then, when we did these things anyway, the second stage of resistance was: “Okay, you can do that-but as long as you don’t disturb society, and keep on doing everything that you did before. You can work full time in the paid labor force, only if you keep on working full time in the unpaid labor force. You cook three gourmet meals a day, you raise two perfect children, you dress for success, and as a women’s magazine once put it, you are “multi-orgasmic till dawn.” It makes you tired just to think about it. Fortunately, we have made two revolutionary discoveries which will help you greatly. First, that children have two parents, and second, that them that eats can also cook. It will take many changes to make men equal in the home, just as it is taking many changes to give women equality outside the home. But it can be done. For instance, parental leave, not just maternity leave, so that fathers can be at home when new babies arrive. Changed work patterns so that both parents of infants and small children can choose to work a shorter day or shorter week. The childcare systems that every other industrialized democracy in the world has begun except the United States. All the many changes were already know about and some that we will discover as we go along. But I wouldn’t be surprised if Henry Durant was ahead of us on this one too. His intellectual mentor was Mrs. Samuel Ripley, who has come down to us without her own name, but who was a Greek Scholar of great accomplishment, a colleague of Emerson, and the mother of seven. Henry Durant said of his revered teacher. “I have seen her holding the baby, shelling the peas and listening to a recitation of in Greek, all at the same moment, without dropping an accent, or particle, or boy, or peapod, or the baby.” At Wellesley, Durant followed her example in well-roundedness by supervising absolutely everything from the cooking of meals to the parsing of verbs. So he would probably be quite pleased if you refused to marry young men unless they are willing to limit their careers for the pleasure of raising children just as much as they expect you to limit yours. And most important, children will be pleased, because they will be growing up with a father instead of too much mother, and too little father. They will know that men can be as loving and nurturing as women can, just as they know that women and men can be equally honored in authority outside the home. Therefore, whether they are boys or girls, they can grow up with all of their human qualities intact. They can grow up as whole people. IDEA #2 We can recognize Women’s Studies, Black Studies, Hispanic Studies, Native American Studies, as what they are: Remedial studies. Anyone who doesn’t have them is actually taking White Male Studies and a lot of people still are- including many women. That’s why a recent study shows that women’s self-esteem actually goes down with every additional year of education. That’s because the higher up you go, the fewer women you see as educator or administrators. It’s still possible, for instance, to graduate from Harvard without ever having a woman full professor. Because you have had the good fortune to go to a women’s college and a women’s college that is proud to have women faculty, and course content that doesn’t ignore the female half of the world, your self-esteem may be much more intact than the average American college graduate. You will be able to help us all work toward the day when we finally have Human History and Human Studies. IDEA #3 While we’re on the subject of a wholeness, remember that Pauline and Henry Durant founded a Student Aid Society almost as soon as they founded Wellesley. Its purpose was to diversify and to complete the student body and they raised money for it mercilessly. In part as a result, the first black woman graduated from Wellesley in 1884. In 1887, Hamlet Wright, a black woman who was to become one of the first female physicians in America, also graduated from Wellesley. So, think about the Task Force on Racism, the Town Meeting you had, the Racial Awareness Day. The Durants might well be proud of these efforts, if not their necessity. And certainly they, who understood so well that wishes to be in inclusive meant little without funding, would agree that the Task Force on Racism needs generous funding if its recommendations are to be put into practice. IDEA #4 As Margaret Mead once said: “Marriage worked well in the 19th century because people only lived to be 50.” Because life expectancy has increased by about 30 years since 1900, there are bound to be different ways of living. Some people will marry and raise children young, then go off amicably for another life of different accomplishments. Some will marry late, after their work lives are well under way, and have children later or not at all. Some will not marry, or will love and live with a partner of the same gender. Others will raise their children among a chosen family of friends, or find colleagues and work and shared ideals who are their spiritual family. As the prison of form diminishes, we can pay more attention to content. That means equal power between partners and thus the possibility of free choice. That means commitment out of decision, not desperation and not pressure. That means kindness, empathy and nurturing. Because those of us who are not parents can help those who are. We can have children as our friends. Even now, the divorce rate has begun to decline, on event that feminists have always predicted. When people use to say to me “Feminism is the cause of divorce.” I always used to say “No. Marriage is the cause of divorce.” Forcing all people to believe they had to live one way was the cause of many bad marriages. Just as forcing all people to believe they had to be parents was the cause of many bad parents and unhappy children. No one way of living can be right for all people. So the message is, don’t worry if our life doesn’t look like a Dick and Jane primer, and don’t worry if it doesn’t look like the yuppie opposite of a Dick and Jane primer. The point is less what we choose, than that we have the power to make a choice. IDEA #5 The family is the microcosm of the state. Isn't that what they told us in political science classes? So how come they never figured out that we will never have a truly democratic state until we have a democratic family? The law doesn’t stop at the family door, as the so-called pro-family forces would have it. Without some guarantees of rights and safety in the household for women, men, and children, we will never have the example and training for equal rights in a larger world. In other words, politics isn't just what goes on in the electoral system or in Washington, politics is any power relationship in our daily lives. Anytime one group is powerful over another, or one individual over another, not because of talent or experience, but just because of sex, or race, or class, that's politics. So when children have only their father's names, that's politics. And when men have one job and women have two, one outside the home and one inside it, that's politics. And when students and faculty of color are present in smaller proportions on our campuses than their proportion in the population, that's politics. So we can have a serious revolution about words and naming, about child care and cooking, about one group deprived of their own culture and another group deprived by living in a white ghetto. We can have a revolution about these things. Indeed, we are. I could list many more thoughts that are, to 1988, what a college for women probably was in 1875. Achieving reproductive freedom, for instance, that is, the right to decide whether and when to have children without government interference, is a basic human right. Or changing those remaining images of God that look remarkably like the ruling class, to an understanding that God is present in women, in men, in all races, and indeed in all living things. As the great archaeologist Henry Breasted commented, after years of studying Egypt, the birthplace of monotheism, “Monotheism is but imperialism in religion.” But I will content myself with just this one last thought which makes it an even half dozen. That violence is never an acceptable way of solving conflict. And indeed the most violent societies are the most sex-role-polarized ones. And the few societies without institutionalized violence have the most flexible sex roles. Males are not told that they must be aggressive, violent, or victorious to earn masculinity. And females are not told they must endure or support aggression in order to be feminine. In uprooting sex roles, we may be rooting out a major paradigm of violence on this fragile spaceship Earth, where we can afford violence no more. Now I know people will scoff at these futuristic goals, just as they did at educated women 113 years ago. They will say that men will never raise children as much as women do. Give me a break,'' they will say. Or that racism and violence is in our genes. But these same people accept male mastery of unknown technologies and their ability to travel in outer space. So they can master the known and rewarding process of child-rearing and voyaging in inner space. Men have been deprived of their whole selves, too. If we accept micro and mega computers, space umbrellas, and cracking the mystery of the human cell, why can't we accept things as small as changing the way we pay each other, honor each other, work together, and raise our children? So I bring you hope for a future that will progress far more rapidly than in the past, because you, the class of 1988, are going to help make it happen.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"At the research center where I spent my sabbatical this year, a group of ten or twelve colleagues met frequently to discuss our work from an interdisciplinary perspective. Since this was California, some of our bet discussions were over potluck suppers after a session in somebody’s hot tub. And the most thought provoking of all our discussions were prompted by a book called Three Guineas, by Virginia Wolf. Three Guineas poses some fundamental challenges to the way we live our lives; and it poses some of the same challenges for the Wellesley graduates as you move from your final year in a woman’s college to the first steps in your profession. I used the term “profession” broadly to mean skilled work of any kind, including the profession of housework and the profession of unpaid organizer for good causes. But my message is directed particularly to those of you who are, or will someday become, ambitious to succeed in a profession more narrowly defined – in business, medicine, teaching, law, journalism, social work. Virginia Woolf was writing in the 1930’s, at a time when women were first making their way in such professions. She believed that the chance to earn our own livings was the most important right women had ever gained, more important even than the vote. She was a strong believer in the talents and capacities of women. But she was worried about the effects that these professions had had on men who were successful in them, and wondered whether there was any way for women to enter the professions and yet avoid the more obsessive and soul-deny aspects of the professional life. As Woolf put it: “It is obvious that if you are going to make the same incomes from the same professions that those men make you will have to accept the same conditions they accept...You will have to leave the house at nine and come back to it at six [parenthetically, one must note that those hours are generous compared to what many professional people wind up doing in demanding jobs these days, on top of a long commute]. That leaves very little time for friendship, travel or art. You will have to perform some duties that are very arduous, others that are very barbarous…In short, you will have to lead the same lives and profess the same loyalties that professional men have professed for many centuries.” Such a life, contends Woolf, not only dramatically truncates the opportunities for other human experience, but also leads easily to possessiveness, pugnacity and greed. The question she raises, therefor, is “how can we enter the professions and yet remain civilized human beings?” It is a question, which could and should be asked by your male counterparts graduating from other colleges and universities, and indeed could and should be asked recurrently by all of us of either sex who are already settled into our professions; but Woolf took it to be a particularly pertinent question for young women. It was her argument that women, not because of any biological differences in our essence, but because of centuries-old differences in experience and culture, come to the professions with a new set of traits. These are the cumulative result of years of exclusion from public life, of that particular strengths and weaknesses that come from living life mainly in the private house. But because these things are culturally rather than biologically rooted, because they have sprung precisely from the conditions in which women in the past have lived, they can quickly disappear. Woolf saw clearly that women who move into the professions on the same terms as men will very quickly begin to behave exactly like their male counterparts, gaining some of the same rewards and paying the same price. Woolf offered two pieces of advice for remaining civilized in the professional world. The first is straight forward, and I commend it to you without reservation: that you “help all qualified people, of whatever sex, class or color, to enter your profession.” Support others as they begin their journey up the professional ladder, rather than paying attention solely to your own progress to the top. And watch out for the assumption that only certain kinds of people are fit to do your work; that is exactly the assumption that kept women out of the professions for so long. But Woolf’s second piece of advice is much harsher. I offer it to you with considerable diffidence: she asks that we keep in touch with what she calls “the four great teachers” of women in the past, the factors which have made us what we are --- “poverty, chastity, derision, and freedom from unreal loyalties.” By poverty, she means that you should set out to earn enough to live on, enough “to buy that modicum of health, leisure, knowledge and so on that is needed for the full development of body and mind,” but not a penny more. By chastity, she means avoiding what she calls “adultery of the brain”: when you have made enough to live on, you must refuse to sell your brain for money, and should give your professional knowledge for nothing to those who need it and cannot pay. By derision, she means refusing all badges and honors and “ways of advertising merit,” believing that “ridicule, obscurity and censure are preferable, for psychological reasons, to fame and praise.” And by freedom from unreal loyalties, freedom from excessive pride in family, institutions, nationality. You can see why I offer this advice, which is a feminist version of advice given by several great moral and religious teachers over the centuries, with diffidence. In our California seminars, we wrestled with Woolf’s challenge, and recognized that we have all come to terms with life in other ways. We give money away to good causes, and we avoid the particular corruptions which come with believing that large amounts of money are the best way to measure value of performance; but none of us practices poverty, even in Woolf’s sense. We try to avoid adulterating our brains, becoming too dependent on praise and recognition, and developing too great an attachment to any particular form of loyalty; but we don’t follow austere counsels of Three Guineas. Our reason is that no one could make headway in the professions by taking her advice literally. If you want to make a difference in the world for good, you must be willing to work hard and also play by at least some of the rules set up for success in the professions. Otherwise none will take you seriously, and you won’t be able to accomplish anything at all. Yet still, Woolf’s counsel challenged us, as it should challenge you. My primary charge to you is to give it some thought, occasionally, as you make your way in your profession. Think of it as one extreme on a spectrum, anchored in your mind to prevent you from moving too quickly all the way to the other end. When you find yourself becoming too obsessed with how much money you are making, as an end in itself; when you find yourself cutting corners and making compromises on things you believe. In order to get ahead and not rock the boat; when you begin to get too addicted to praise and honor, and worry too much about censure and ridicule: or when you find yourself so caught up in particular kinds of loyalties that you can no longer see the full humanity of other human beings, take Three Guineas off the shelf as a salutary antidote. I hope that Wellesley has taught you some lessons of this kind, in a addition to preparing you to success at whatever it is you choose to do. You are a wonderful group of women – talented, eager, vigorous – and we look forward to watching you change the world for good. Don’t forget to come back occasionally to report on your progress and refresh your ties with people who care about you here. May the memories of the beauty of this place bring you serenity in troubled times. Our blessing and best thoughts go with you. Good luck to each and al\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"It is a very special pleasure for me to be here at Wellesley College today, a pleasure that goes back to my childhood. I was born on the island of Manhattan and grew up in New York, a solitary, only child, with parents almost old enough to be my grandparents, with full lives of their own, so when I wasn't in school I had a lot of time to myself. When I was in fourth grade I was put into a school which is still in existence, so it will be nameless, which was supposed to be one of the best schools in the city. In that school it was very important that one be good at sports. One of my legs was longer than the other -- still is, so I was clumsy and not a good runner. Any team which had the misfortune to have me on its side automatically lost. The kids would choose sides and the unlucky team to get me would let out anguished groans, and I can't blame them. I was hardly an asset to team sports. However, for some reason which is still not clear to me, my home room teacher decided that since I couldn't run relay races, I wasn't very bright. She simply accepted the other students' assessment of me, and I couldn't do anything right. I quickly learned that there was no point in doing homework for her, because she was going to hold it up in ridicule to the class, or put it down. So I would go home and dump down my school books and not look at them again, say wryly to myself that I was the dumb one, the unpopular one, and then I would move into the real world, where I read stories, wrote stories, and tried in my own way to find out what human relationships were all about. It was also in fourth grade that I learned about the perfidy of the adult world, and the earlier this is learned the better; it can come as a terrible shock if it doesn't hit you till later. I learned it in French class, which was being taught by a very large French woman. I needed to be excused, and I raised my hand, and my French teacher wouldn't let me leave the room. Three times I raised my hand, each time a little more desperately than the time before, and three times she refused to let me go. When the bell rang for it I ran, and I didn't make it. Now, to wet your pants in fourth grade is really pretty horrendous. My mother came for me, and here was this little wet mess. I told her what had happened, and she went to the principal. The principal called in the French teacher, and the French teacher said, Well, Madeleine never asked to be excused. of course if she'd raised her hand I'd have let her go. She's just ashamed of wetting her pants, a big girl like that. Tell her not to lie about it next time. So there was a grown up lying, and being believed, and I, only a child, was not. And that made me determined never to be like that French teacher. No matter what it cost I was going to stay on the side of truth. The next year there was a poetry contest which was open to the entire school, and judged by the head of the English department. The entries weren't screened, or I'd never have got one in. My poem won the contest, and my home room teacher predictably said, Madeleine couldn't possibly have written that poem. She's not very bright, you know. She must have copied it from some place. So my mother went up to school, bearing the large body of work I had produced when I should have been doing homework, and it had to be conceded that Madeleine could have written that poem after all. I was taken out of that school and sent to another, where I had a homeroom teacher on her very first teaching job. She was the first person to see any potential in this shy, awkward child. She affirmed me, gave me extra work to do. I remember she had me write a sequel to the Oddessey with Telemachus as the hero. Her honoring of me helped the other students to see me as something more than the girl who was bad at relay races. I didn't have instant popularity, but I began to make friends. I did my homework with enthusiasm, because my teacher challenged me. Her name was Margaret Clapp, and she was to become the eighth president of Wellesley. So I had the benefit of being taught by a woman who was not only a great educator, but a great person, and perhaps it is only a great educator who understands that part of education is affirming each person she encounters as being intrinsically valuable. My previous teachers had estimated me as worthless; Miss Clapp gave me a sense of value, that it was all right to be me, that my lack of athletic skills was more than compensated for by other skills, that imagination was important. Miss Clapp also helped me into a creative realism. I gave up some impossible dreams of making the longest or the highest jumps in gym; I accepted that I had a bad knee and that this would prevent me from being a great athlete, but I also accepted that not everybody has to be a great athlete. I learned to be willing to be who I was, not the plastic model of who I had thought I wanted to be. It was not that I didn't attempt the impossible. I did. But it was the impossible in areas where I already showed promise. My sequel to the Oddessey was probably pretty terrible, but it was a good example of the right kind of impossible, the impossible that called into play the gifts I already had, the gift of gab, the gift of putting words together articulately, the gift of imagination. I hope that you have encountered teachers who understand the importance of imagination, that part of the brain which goes beyond cognition to intuition. A recent article in the New York Times dealt with the discovery that there is far more to the brain than the conscious part which is concerned with facts and proof, and that many, if not most major discoveries have been made with the intuitive part of the brain when the scientist is thinking, but has relaxed, so that the whole brain can work, and not just the conscious, controllable area. Of course this is a masculine discovery, new to the male of the species but not to the female. Women have been allowed by society to be far more whole then men; we have not been forced to repress our inner selves, our intuitive, imaginative, numinous side. We have been allowed to go down into the darkness of unexpectedness, whereas men have been forced by society to limit themselves to the reasonable, the rational, the provable. I, too, went to a women's college, Smith college. One great advantage of a women's college is that whatever there is to be done, we women do. If there is a magazine to be started, we start it. If there is an officer to be elected, one of us will be elected. I left college and went to New York to earn my living with the assurance that all doors were of course open to me, and that's a good attitude to have. If you expect doors to be open, they're likely to be open. If you expect them to be closed, they're likely to slam in your face. And I left college having majored in English literature, having spent four years with great writers, with an understanding that intellect and intuition were equally important. In Greek mythology the intellect is masculine, Apollo driving the chariot of the sun across the sky, whereas wisdom is feminine, Sophia, or better, Hagia Sophia, holy wisdom. It is quite possible to be intellectual without any wisdom whatsoever, and this is always disastrous. And wisdom without intellect can be too otherworldly to be effective. It is when the two work together that true maturity can be realized. It is when the two work together that our wonderful minds can turn us towards truth. Intellect alone wants facts, provable facts; intellect working with wisdom can understand that truth goes far beyond and transcends facts. One of my early home room teachers accused me of telling a story. She was not complimenting me on my fertile imagination; she was making the deadly accusation that I was telling a lie. It is only when the brain is limited to the cognitive alone that story can be confused with untruth, whereas story is one of the most potent vehicles of truth available to the human being. Now, when I am talking about male and female I am not talking about men vs women, because we all have a marvelous combination of male and female within us, and part of maturing is learning to balance these two components so that they are the most fertile. It is only then that we are able to make creative choices and to understand that we do indeed have choices. I have had the pleasure of living with my two granddaughters during their college years, and not long ago we were having dinner with several of their classmates, and one young woman said that their Women's Studies professor had told them that any woman who married and had children and who wrote, was a martyr. My granddaughter, Charlotte, looked at me, asking, Gran, were you a martyr? I replied, No, Charlotte, I was not a martyr. I chose my own conflicts. They were indeed conflicts, but I chose them. No one forced me to marry, to have children, to continue to go on writing. It was my free choice. So there's no way I could be a martyr. Don't fall into martyrdom! That's a choice, too. So is being a victim. I don't like that word. When bad things happen it is up to me to choose to be a victim or to get on with it. Terrible things can happen to us, rape, accident, bereavement; life is precarious and full of the unexpected, but we do not have to become victims, no matter what happens. That is a choice, and one we do not have to make. If we chose to remain ourselves, full of potential, then we can take whatever happens and redeem it by openness, courage, and willingness to move on. As women it is our responsibility to use all parts of ourselves, male and female, intellect and intuition, conscious and subconscious minds. From my college reading of Aristotle's Poetics I remember particularly this phrase, That which is plausible and impossible is better than that which is possible and implausible, and that has had a profound effect on my adult life. When we believe in the impossible, it becomes possible, and we can do all kinds of extraordinary things. We can balance the male and female within us like an acrobat in the circus, and that balancing act is one of the most important choices open to US. We can dare to enter the vulnerable intimacy of friendship and love. Some of you will choose the underrated job of homemaker, of wife and mother. Some of you will go single-mindedly after a career. Some of you, like me, will make the difficult choice of choosing both but then, as I used to tell my children, nothing that's easy is really worth very much, and just because it's difficult is no reason not to try. Remember that one of the glories of being human is that we are fallible. We are the creatures who learn by making mistakes. I don't know about you, but I learn by what I do wrong, not by what I do right. An ant does not have this privilege. In ant societies if an ant deviates from the pattern that ant is a goner. Ants do not have the freedom of choice that we have. So my hope for all of you is that you have been affirmed as valuable during these college years, and that you leave here knowing who you are, what your strengths are, and what your weaknesses are, and that the greatest human beings are a marvelous mixture of both. I hope that you know that you have choices, and that you have the freedom to discover what is true for you, and to follow that choice. Miss Clapp gave me the gift of being willing to know myself, with realism, and with hope. She was the first person to help me to know where and how I could break through the possible to the impossible, and to understand that it is when we plunge into something difficult that we are given whatever tools we need. She helped to start me on what has been and is still a fascinating journey, full of unexpected joys and sorrows and challenges. So I hope the same for you, that you will use fully the Apollo, the intellect, which is a great glory, and rejoice equally in Sophia, the wisdom which makes the intellect creative instead of destructive. Women are needed in a world which is hung up on the literal, the provable. So go out there with courage and imagination and be fully whoever you are, because that is who you are meant to be. Then the impossible becomes possible, and you will give hope wherever you are. Go, and God bless you.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"President Keohane, trustees, faculty, students, parents, friends, and, most of all, honored graduates of the Class of 1992. This is my second chance to speak from this podium. The first was 23 years ago, when I was a graduating senior. My classmates selected me to address them as the first Wellesley student ever to speak at a commencement. I can't claim that 1969 speech as my own; it reflected the hopes, values, and aspirations of the women in my graduating class. It was full of the uncompromising language you only write when you are 21. But it's uncanny the degree to which those same hopes, values, and aspirations have shaped my adulthood. We passionately rejected the notion of limitations on our abilities to make the world a better place. We saw a gap between our expectations and realities, and we were inspired, in large part by our Wellesley education, to bridge that gap. On behalf of the class of 1969, I said, The challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible, possible. That is still the challenge of politics, especially in today's far more cynical climate. The aspiration I referred to then was the struggle for an integrated life... in an atmosphere of... trust and respect. What I meant by that was a life that combines personal fulfillment in love and work with fulfilling responsibility to the larger community. A life that balances family, work, and service throughout life. It's not a static concept, but a constant journey. When the ceremonies and hoopla of my graduation were over, I commenced my adult life by heading straight for Lake Waban. Now, as you know, swimming in the lake, other than at the beach, is not allowed. But it was one of my favorite rules to break. I stripped down to my swimsuit, took off my Coke-bottle glasses, laid them carefully on top of my clothes and waded in off Tupelo Point. While I was happily paddling around, feeling relieved I had survived the day, a security guard came by on his rounds, picked up my clothes from the shore and carried them off. He also took my glasses. Blind as a bat, I had to feel my way back to my room at Davis. I'm just glad that picture hasn't also come back to haunt me. You can imagine the captions: Girl offers vision to classmates and then loses her own. Or, the tabloids might have run something like: Girl swimming, blinded by aliens after seeing Elvis. While medical technology has allowed me to replace those glasses with contact lenses, I hope my vision today is clearer for another reason: the clarifying perspective of experience. The opportunity to share that experience with you today is a privilege and a kind of homecoming. Wellesley nurtured, challenged, and guided me; it instilled in me, not just knowledge, but a reserve of sustaining values. I also made friends who are still among my closest friends today. When I arrived as a freshman in 1965 from my Ozzie and Harriet suburb of Chicago, both the College and the country were going through a period of rapid, sometimes tumultuous changes. My classmates and I felt challenged and, in turn, challenged the College from the moment we arrived. Nothing was taken for granted. Our Vil Juniors despaired of us green-beanied '69ers because we couldn't even agree on an appropriate, politically correct cheer. To this day when we attend reunions, you can hear us cry: 1-9-6-9 Wellesley Rah, one more year, still no cheer. There often seemed little to cheer about. We grew up in a decade dominated by dreams and disillusionments. Dreams of the civil rights movement, of the Peace Corps, of the space program. Disillusionments starting with President Kennedy's assassination, accelerated by the divisive war in Vietnam, and the deadly mixture of poverty, racism, and despair that burst into flames in the hearts of some cities and which is still burning today. A decade when speeches like I Have a Dream were followed by songs like The Day the Music Died. I was here on campus when Martin Luther King was murdered. My friends and I put on black armbands and went into Boston to march in anger and pain—feeling as many of you did after the acquittals in the Rodney King case. Much has changed—and much of it for the better—but much has also stayed the same, or at least not changed as fast or as irrevocably as we had hoped. Each new generation takes us into new territory. But while change is certain, progress is not. Change is a law of nature; progress is the challenge for both a life and society. Describing an integrated life is easier than achieving one. Yet, what better place to speak on integrating the strands of women's lives than Wellesley, a college that not only vindicates the proposition that there is still an essential place for an all-women's college, but which defines its mission as seeking to educate women who will make a difference in the world. And what better time to speak than in the spring of 1992, when women's concerns are so much in the news, as real women—and even fictional television characters—seek to strike the balances in their lives that are right for them. I've traveled all over America, talking and listening to women who are: struggling to raise their children and somehow make ends meet; battling against the persistent discrimination that still limits their opportunities for pay and promotion; bumping up against the glass ceiling; watching their insurance premiums increase; coping with inadequate or nonexistent child support payments; existing on shrinking welfare payments with no available jobs in sight; anguishing over the prospect that abortions will be criminalized again. We also talk about our shared values as women and mothers, about our common desire to educate our children, to be sure they receive the health care they need, to protect them from the escalating violence in our streets. We worry about our children—something mothers do particularly well. Women who pack lunch for their kids, or take the early bus to work, or stay out late at the PTA, or spend every spare minute taking care of aging parents don't need lectures from Washington about values. We don't need to hear about an idealized world that never was as righteous or carefree as some would like to think. We need understanding and a helping hand to solve our own problems. We're doing the best we can to find the right balance in our lives. For me, the elements of that balance are family, work, and service. First, your personal relationships. When all is said and done, it is the people in your life, the friendships you form and the commitments you maintain, that give shape to your life. Your friends and your neighbors, the people at work or church, all those who touch your daily lives. And if you choose, a marriage filled with love and respect. When I stood here before, I could never have predicted—much less believed—that I would fall in love with Bill Clinton and follow my heart to Arkansas. But I'm very glad I had the courage to make that choice. Second, your work. For some of you, that may overlap with your contribution to the community. For some of you, the future might not include work outside the home (and I don't mean involuntary unemployment); but most of you will at some point in your life work for pay, maybe in jobs that used to be off-limits for women. You may choose to be a corporate executive or a rocket scientist, you may choose to run for public office, you may choose to stay home and raise your children—you can now make any or all of these choices for the work of your life. Third, your service. As students, we debated passionately what responsibility each individual has for the larger society and just what the College's Latin motto—Not to be ministered unto, but to minister—actually meant. The most eloquent explanation I have found of what I believe now and what I argued then is from Vaclav Havel, the playwright and first freely-elected president of Czechoslovakia. In a letter from prison to his wife, Olga, he wrote: Everything meaningful in life is distinguished by a certain transcendence of individual human existence—beyond the limits of mere “self-care”—toward other people, toward society, toward the world.... Only by looking outward, by caring for things that, in terms of pure survival, you needn't bother with at all... and by throwing yourself over and over again into the tumult of the world, with the intention of making your voice count—only thus will you really become a person. I first recognized what I cared most about while I was in law school where I worked with children at the Yale New Haven Hospital and Child Study Center and represented children through legal services. And where during my first summer I worked for the Children's Defense Fund. My experiences gave voice to deep feelings about what children deserved from their families and government. I discovered that I wanted my voice to count for children. Some of you may have already had such a life-shaping experience; for many, it lies ahead. Recognize it and nurture it when it occurs. Because my concern is making children count, I hope you will indulge me as I tell you why. The American Dream is an intergenerational compact. Or, as someone once said, one generation is supposed to leave the key under the mat for the next. We repay our parents for their love in the love we give our children—and we repay our society for the opportunities we are given by expanding the opportunities granted others. That's the way it's supposed to work. You know too well that it is not. Too many of our children are being impoverished financially, socially, and spiritually. The shrinking of their futures ultimately diminishes us all. Whether you end up having children of your own or not, I hope each of you will recognize the need for a sensible national family policy that reverses the neglect of our children. If you have children, you will owe the highest duty to them and will confront your biggest challenges as parents. If, like me at your age, you now know little (and maybe care less) about the mysteries of good parenting, I can promise you there is nothing like on-the-job-training. I remember one very long night when my daughter, Chelsea, was about four weeks old and crying inconsolably. Nothing from the courses in my political science major seemed to help. Finally, I said, Chelsea, you've never been a baby before and I've never been a mother before, we're going to have to help each other get through this together. So far, we have. For Bill and me, she has been the great joy of our life. Watching her grow and flourish has given greater urgency to the task of helping all children. There are many ways of helping children. You can do it through your own personal lives by being dedicated, loving parents. You can do it in medicine or music, social work or education, business or government service, by making policy or making cookies. It is a false choice to tell women—or men for that matter—that we must choose between caring for ourselves and our own families or caring for the larger family of humanity. In their recent Pastoral Letter, Putting Children and Families First, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops captured this essential interplay of private and public roles: No government can love a child and no policy can substitute for a family's care, the Bishops wrote, but government can either support or undermine families.... There has been an unfortunate, unnecessary, and unreal polarization in discussions of how best to help families.... The undeniable fact is that our children's future is shaped both by the values of their parents and the policies of our nation. As my husband says, Family values alone won't feed a hungry child. And material security cannot provide a moral compass. We need both. Forty-five years ago, the biggest threat to our country came from the other side of the Iron Curtain; from the nuclear weapons that could wipe out the entire planet. While you were here at Wellesley, that threat ended. Today, our greatest national threat comes not from some external Evil Empire, but from our own internal Indifferent Empire that tolerates splintered families, unparented children, embattled schools, and pervasive poverty, racism, and violence. Not for one more year can our country think of children as some asterisk on our national agenda. How we treat our children should be front and center of our national agenda, or it won't matter what else is on that agenda. My plea is that you not only nurture the values that will determine the choices you make in your personal lives, but also insist on policies with those values to nurture our nation's children. But, really, Hillary, some of you may be saying to yourselves, I've got to pay off my student loans. I can't even find a good job, let alone someone to love. How am I going to worry about the world? Our generation has fewer dreams, fewer illusions than yours. And I hear you. As women today, you face tough choices. You know the rules are basically as follows: If you don't get married, you're abnormal. If you get married but don't have children, you're a selfish yuppie. If you get married and have children, but work outside the home, you're a bad mother. If you get married and have children, but stay home, you've wasted your education. And if you don't get married, but have children and work outside the home as a fictional newscaster, then you're in trouble with Dan Quayle. So you see, if you listen to all the people who make these rules, you might just conclude that the safest course of action is just to take your diploma and crawl under your bed. But let me propose an alternative. Hold onto your dreams. Take up the challenge of forging an identity that transcends yourself. Transcend yourself and you will find yourself. Care about something you needn't bother with at all. Throw yourself into the world and make your voice count. Whether you make your voice count for children or for another cause, enjoy your life's journey. There is no dress rehearsal for life, and you will have to ad lib your way through each scene. The only way to prepare is to do what you have done: Get the best possible education; continue to learn from literature, scripture and history, to understand the human experience as best you can so that you have guideposts charting the terrain toward whatever decisions are right for you. I want you to remember this day and remember how much more you have in common with each other than with the people who are trying to divide you. And I want you to stand together then as you stand together now; beautiful, brave, invincible. Congratulations. Look forward to the challenges ahead. God Speed.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"It's very nice to be here. It seems so familiar; I froze the whole time I was here. Here I am again. It's also nice to be in a familiar place because Washington is getting less familiar with every passing day. It's getting harder and harder to explain what's going on there, and we're losing some of our most familiar characters who we used to be able to count on to have continuity. When I'm in the Boston area, I can't help but think about Tip O'Neill, who, of course, was Mr. Speaker for so long, and a great and dear friend. I saw him about a week before he died, and he was at an event to raise money for a scholarship for a student, and he got up and told a story that I just love because he prefaced it by saying Mrs. O'Neill didn't like for him to tell this story. And I thought Dear Lord, what could it possibly be? The idea of Tip O'Neill telling a risqué story was too tantalizing for words. It started, as so many do, with a man dying, going to heaven, getting to the gates. Saint Peter says, My son, you have been a good and noble servant of the Lord. You may have any wish you want. What would you like it to be? And he says, I want to see the Blessed Mother; I have a question to ask her. Saint Peter says, Done. So the guy goes in and he meets Mary and she says, I understand you have a question, my son. And he said, Yes. You know, over all those centuries, in all that art--every stained glass window, every statue, every painting--when you're holding the baby Jesus, you look sad. Why is that? She says, I wanted a girl. I must say, it has not always been so familiar at Wellesley. My mother's words, that Diana read, were not her first words about Wellesley, I want you to know. When I came here, as a freshman, it was pouring. I'm the youngest child, and my mother and father, for reasons that still escape me, lo these many years later, decided to drive me to college; this was very unlike them. And we got here and were doing all the usual things, you know, opening the bank account, mama was sewing in name tags and all that stuff. And then, as they drove off and left me behind, drove off the campus in the pouring rain, my mother burst into tears, and said to my father, We've left our baby in a Yankee, Protestant, Republican school. Every time we tease mom about it, she says, Well, it's true. I must say, that even thought it's cold, I'm glad to have a sunny graduation. It poured on my graduation here, too, and we were indoors, and our graduation speaker (this was the year 1964) was McGeorge Bundy. Now, I know that you all weren't born and all that, but he became rather famous and was someone that the Vietnam War was somewhat blamed on. And I think back on that peaceful graduation day, and how nobody thought about such a thing as protest or anything like that. If the poor man had shown up on campus a few years later, he probably would have been stoned. But it was a different time, and I was thinking about some of the things that made it a different time. And of course one of the things, one of the facts for us as young women, was that the thought of war was not something that really had touched us--and we couldn't imagine it touching us. As the immediate years after that went by, it touched us vicariously through the men that we were involved with. Some of us have children as a result of that war, and we like them, we're very glad that they're there--but it did happen. But the idea that we might be involved, was something that never occurred to us, and really has never occurred to women until now. And the first time I was really struck by it was in listening to the Congressional debate on the Persian Gulf War. It was a wonderful and studious debate. It was really Congress at it's best--one of those times when it's easy to explain, as opposed to the usual--and I was struck by the language, because people in the House and Senate kept talking about our men and women in uniform, our men and women in Saudi Arabia, our men and women in the Gulf, and it was just remarkable. We had never heard that before, ever. I mean the dirty little secret is that women have been in our military since the Revolutionary War, but we've never talked about it openly before. And then it struck me that we really had never talked about our men either, it had always been our boys--our boys in Vietnam, our boys in Korea, our boys in Europe, which led me to the quite wonderful observation that this was not the first time that a woman had turned a boy...into a man. I am honored to be here, to be back, not only because it's a place I really care about enormously, but because you've had such a fabulous group of graduation speakers in recent years. I mean it's been sort of First Lady Central. I loved the year that you had Barbara Bush, and then she had the sense to bring along Raisa Gorbachev, who, of course, was noted for her philosophy degree. I mean that was it, right? And then Hillary Clinton, of course, recently, before she was First Lady. When I was here the only first lady that was ever around was Mei-ling Soong, and that was a sort of an interesting situation, but I won't dwell on that. I did ask Mrs. Clinton about Wellesley, what she thought. I saw her not too long ago, and she said, Well, things really haven't changed there a lot. She said, They changed in the middle, but they're back again. And I took that to be an endorsement. I was shocked, though, by something she said a week ago today, about another first lady, about Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. And here's what Mrs. Clinton said, quote The choices one makes have to be her own. I thought about that, and of course that's true: you do make all kinds of choices and they do have to be your own. But life presents a lot of choices that you don't expect as well. Jackie Kennedy didn't expect to be a widow at age 34. She then had to make choices about how she was going to live that life. Today would have been my sister's 55th birthday. She loved the color purple. She would have loved to see the balloons around. She didn't choose to die at 51 of cancer, and I didn't choose to have an old age without her. But life presents you with choices that you then have to deal with and adapt to. My mother did not expect my father's plane to fall out of the sky but at age 58 made the choice to run for office herself, as a widow. So I think there are a lot of choices that are made for you, but there are then things that you do to choose to deal with them in various ways. I noticed in a letter that I got, as a member of the community, from Diana concerning one of your many controversies. She said, In an increasingly interdependent and multi-cultural world, we must find better ways to discover and rally round the common bonds that unite us amid our diversity. At Wellesley, we will continue to provide a learning experience that prepares women for the complexity of a changing world. --Choices that are thrust on you. I got my class reunion book yesterday, the 1964 book. Thank God for it because I was not prepared for this speech; I was having to cram. I had thought that I would have plenty of time, and then I was sent off to do a story about the Citadel, about a young woman wanting to get into the Citadel. I tried to keep an open mind, thinking that as I talked to these young men, Now, pretend they're women, pretend they're women, and put everything they say in that context. But that became really hard because they said things to me like, 'Well, we can't have girls around here, I mean, you know, what would happen when we get together in the morning and we all pull each other's pants down and stuff? I swear to you, they said that. Whew! But it did throw me off my stride about having a chance to write a speech to you, and I got home and found that I had my class reunion book, and I was just struck by the choices that people at our age, 30 years out of here, feel that they are continuing to make and having to make, that it is all still sort of in front of them in a variety of ways. Let me read you just a few selections here. This one is from a lawyer who is the mother of a 10 year-old--now that's a choice that's less open to us than it is to men, to have children at age 50. She says, On October 1st, my employer from the last 14 years ceased to be an independent public company, and became a wholly owned subsidiary of another company, one that Jay [student commencement speaker at Wellesley today] wants to be Editor-in-Chief of, actually. The year leading up to this event was very exciting and busy for me as the company's sole inside lawyer; however, what this change will mean for me in terms of future professional challenge is still not entirely clear. So I'm beginning to think about what I will do when I grow up. Here's another. This is a college professor. She has grown children, second marriage. I'm somewhat unnerved by my present stage of life. I'm uncertain about my direction in my work and unsettled by the necessary changes in our family relationships as our kids become independent and we become ever more clearly the older generation. Still, even as I mull over my next steps, I count my many blessings, including a loving family, a happy marriage, and many, many pleasures. I've developed enough sense over the years to know that uncomfortable transitions are necessary for growth to happen. At 51, I guess I'm having growing pains again. And then this one (this is another lawyer--this might say more about lawyers than life, I'm not sure): My world is one of transition, both in attitude and in actuality. I feel as though I'm in the middle of one of those books, in which you can choose a number of possible twists to the plot and don't know the end until you get there. I'm still picking plots. I'm not sure I'll know the story line any time soon. Anyway, I plug along as a lawyer, continue to be fascinated with the development of women's issues, appreciate my friends and supporters more and more, and revel in the warmth of my wonderful family. I think that this book is actually a fascinating book. It has stories for everyone. I mean Sally Jessy and Oprah could have a wonderful time with it. It does have the whole spectrum of American stories...and it is so interesting to me because we were not a very diverse group, and yet we have led somewhat diverse lives. A lot of people ask in the book, Where is the wisdom of middle age? A lot of them answer that question very profoundly. It's very clear that their lives have been touched, not only by the tragedies of normal life, the deaths of family members, the loss of people who were close to them and by the blessings of normal life. But they've also been touched by the particular tragedies of these times that we live in. You tend to think that only you are affected by these things but let me read from another classmate. I've been touched by AIDS. A fellow piano teacher spent two awful years trying to stay upbeat in the face of his approaching death. He and his faith were an inspiration to me, but it seemed like such a waste for him to die. I've also been touched by unprovoked violence: a good friend's husband was killed in the massacre at Luby's cafeteria in Killeen, Texas. She's now living on the edge financially. Another professional friend's oldest child, 39 years old with two children, 11 and 7, was killed last week in San Antonio by a couple of teenagers who ambushed him. My friend's willingness to forgive the murderers of her son is also an inspiration to me. She's taking great comfort that his organs have improved the lives of over 300 other people. Wouldn't it have been better if that good man could have lived out his full life? What can be done about the lack of care of our children, for the lives of others? And finally, another classmate, touched by the particular times in which we live. My husband Ezio was assassinated in March 1985 by the Red Brigades, and two years later I was asked to enter politics. Why did I enter politics? At the time I was asked to run, I felt that what had been my life up to the moment of Estio's assassination had been destroyed, not by private rage and violence, but by a political act, and that the offer of the candidacy had placed me up against the choice of either trying to put my life back together on the level that I had lived it before the assassination or of becoming an actor in the sphere from which the destruction had come. I felt that the only choice I had was to try to combat destruction as I could on that level. Another factor which decided me in favor of the candidacy was the fact that I ran on a feminist ticket, and I thought and think that we need more women in politics. Yes, Jay, yes indeed. We need more women in politics. You talked about Roslyn. The person I like to quote is an assemblywoman in Connecticut who is a plumber by trade, who said when she was talking about the importance of getting involved in public service, she said, I figured I either had to stop complaining or run for office, and I knew I couldn't stop complaining. It's important of course to have women in politics for all of the reasons that you know about. It is something that I see constantly, the issues that they bring to the fore. But one of them--and this is the place where I think in the end you will have no choice--one of them is that they bring their role as caretakers to the world of politics. And that is what I see as a theme running through my class book: that you will make that choice no matter what other choice you make, that you will be the caretakers in this society. It's what we do. That's what women do. We're the nurturers, we're the carriers of the culture. And whether you run for president or run the Patriot's Day race or become editor-in-chief of the New York Times (though you might want to talk to me before you do that), whether you do, as Hillary said, make policy or bake cookies, (it's been my experience that one generally does both) that what you will still be doing, no matter whatever else you do, will be being the caretakers. Ronald Reagan offended people when he said that women should be honored as civilizers. That statement was offensive because he said it to a group of professional women and defined them in terms of their relationship to men. He said they were civilizers of men. But he was right. We are. (I must say that men sometimes make it a little difficult, but that is what we do.) We can't avoid it. And, as I say, in politics, it is the women who are constantly bringing the civilizing issues to the forefront, the caretaking issues, the issues of concern to families and children. Right now the focus in Congress, on the part of women, is on women's health and all of the myriad issues affecting women's health, from reproductive health, birth control, mammograms, all the way through breast cancer research, all of the things. That is primary concern to the women in Congress because if they don't do it, nobody else will. I had an experience a few years back where, what the women in Congress do is, you know, they sort of bring women's issues up like Chinese water torture and constantly drip them on the heads of their male companions until finally they get passed. A few years back there was this tremendous effort to get mammograms covered by Medicare, and it was getting very hard to do, and there were not enough women on the appropriate committees to have it in place every step of the way of the process, so one woman who was a lobbyist went to a male friend on a committee and said, I need you to bring up this mammogram legislation. And he said, Oh, I can't do that. I did the last bit of legislation for women in the subcommittee. Everybody will think I'm soft on women. And she said, Nah, just tell 'em you're a breast man. He did. It worked! But I have to tell you I don't just see this role of women as caretakers in the world that I cover, I see it in the world I live in. Slowly, slowly, slowly but definitely, the workplace is becoming a more humane place because of the presence of women. The idea that time can be taken for family, whether it's having children or caring for sick people or elderly people in your family. That is becoming more possible for the men in the work place as well as for the women in the work place because of the fights that we have fought over the last several decades. But I also do see it in my personal life. Four years ago this time when my sister was dying, she was completely surrounded by a network of caretaking women--her mother, her sister, the nuns who had taught us, the nurses, women doctors, her hairdresser who would come and make her beautiful, and then circles of women around that. My daughter was in college at the time in Princeton. She was taking care of my sister; the women in her class were taking care of her. The women in my profession were spelling each other on vacations so that somebody would always be there for me--these are busy, journalistic women. The women in Congress were doing the same thing for my mother, supporting her and caretaking her because that was what they understood they needed to do for each other and for her--was to say Yes under those circumstances. What I would say is that it is impossible to shake the caretaker role even if you wanted to, and I will revert just briefly once again to my class book to one hysterical line from a friend saying, George's parents are still in good health and maintain active lives. We think it's remarkable that his 81 year old father and 78 year old mother look after George's 100 year old grandmother, who still lives alone in her Wisconsin farmhouse. May we all do as well. So you can't shake it, but I don't know why you would want to. Life is long. You have many opportunities ahead of you. You have so many more opportunities than so many people. You are privileged and blessed. And you will have the opportunity to say Yes to many different things, but you also will have the opportunity in the saying of Yes to say No sometimes, to say No, it's not right for me, and my family, right now, to take this great job offer. And you know what? Another one will come along. I'm living proof of that. You can do it all. There are times when you have to not do it all at once. There are times when you don't sleep. But you can do it if you have some sense about saying, This is what's right now, this is where I am now, and this is the care I need to take right now. I think that it is important to look at the long view as you go out of here and realize that there's a long time ahead, and there is time to see it all, to do it all, and to do it in ways that make you proud and happy in the end. One last reading from a friend: I've been thinking lately about the changing size of my world, interior and exterior. Our generation grew up with rosy expectations about the economy, about the invincibility of our country, about the boundless possibilities for our lives. Yes, there were much more limited opportunities for women, and nearly unfathomable dangers, such as the threat of nuclear annihilation. But I think most of us felt a personal optimism which our children do not. What they see is a shrinking job market, AIDS, drugs, crime, homelessness, thinning ozone, and more and more cynicism about the possibility of fundamental change. We came of age in a time of hope, of Camelot, when anything seemed possible--and they're growing up in post-Watergate, post-Vietnam, post-decade of greed, crisis of faith. Now, as many corporate giants downsize, I find myself doing the same. The medium-sized theater company I worked for in the '80's failed, and I'm now working for a smaller one. With one child gone and one back only temporarily from college, my live-in family has shrunk. As my husband considers retirement, we face a smaller income. As hormone changes take their toll, I find myself with less energy. Through my fifty-year-old eyes, even the print has grown smaller. One of my happiest moments came, though, when I finally discovered, late in my forties, that I didn't have to accomplish something huge in order to succeed. Corollaries of this discovery were that I didn't have to save the world, publish the great American novel, or be Superwoman all the time; however, I could launch a scholarship fund for a deceased Wellesley friend, become a pretty good theater marketing director, and learn to be a more compassionate family member and friend. The long view: when we were living in Greece, we used to go to this beach at Marathon--just think of it.... And there was a little museum there, a little tiny museum from well before the Battle of Marathon that you've studied, with artifacts from 7000 years ago. And you looked in these cases, and there were buttons, there were frying pans, there were mirrors, there was jewelry--and it was remarkable to look at. You could open them and put on--you could put it on and use it right away! It was totally recognizable to the lives of women today. For men, what was in those cases? Well, there were some bows and arrows, and there were some articles of worship, so if you were a soldier or a priest there was something. But if you just went about leading your daily lives, there wasn't something terribly recognizable for you. That's what we have: we have this wonderful, wonderful continuum. So I say to you, young women of Wellesley, open up those cases. Take up the tools and put on the jewels--of your foremothers and sisters. Go out into this world and take good care of it. Thank you.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"President DeGioia, faculty, parents and friends, and, especially, graduates: On this day of celebration, I want to ask you to pause for a minute, and to think of the ending of a tragic drama, Euripides’ The Trojan Women. The towers of Troy are burning. All that is left of the once-proud city is a group of ragged women, bound for slavery, their husbands dead in battle, their sons murdered by the conquering Greeks, their daughters raped. Hecuba their queen invokes the king of the gods, using, remarkably, the language of democratic citizenship: “Son of Kronus, Council-President of Troy, father who gave us birth, do you see these undeserved sufferings that your Trojan people bear?” The Chorus answers grimly, “He sees, and yet the great city is no city. It has perished, and Troy exists no longer.” A little later, Hecuba and the Chorus conclude that the very name of their land has been wiped out. In one way, the ending of this drama is as bleak as any in the history of tragic drama. Death, rape, slavery, fire destroying the towers, the city’s very name effaced from the record of history by rapacious and murderous Greeks. And yet, of course, it did not happen that way, not exactly. For the story of Troy’s fall is being enacted, some six hundred years after the event, by a company of Greek actors, in the Greek language of a Greek poet, in the presence of all the adult citizens of Athens, most powerful of Greek cities. Hecuba’s cry to the gods even imagines him as a peculiarly Athenian type of civic official, president of the city council. So the name of the land didn’t get wiped out after all. The imaginations of the conquerors were haunted by it, transmitted it, and mourn it. Obsessively their arts repeat the events of long-ago destruction, typically inviting, as here, the audience’s compassion for the women of Troy and blame for their assailants. In its very structure the play makes a claim for the moral value of compassionate imagining, as it asks its audience to partake in the terror of a burning city, of murder and rape and slavery. Insofar as members of the audience are engaged by this drama, feeling fear and grief for the conquered city, they demonstrate the ability of compassion to cross lines of time, place, and nation - and also, in the case of most of the audience, the line of sex, perhaps more difficult yet to cross. Nor was the play an aesthetic event cut off from political reality. The dramatic festivals of Athens were sacred festivals strongly connected to the idea of democratic deliberation, “Without families and their intense loyalties, we will have, Aristotle says, a ‘watery’ kind of care all round. Nonetheless, when we observe how narrow and partisan our compassion usually is, we must ask how it can be educated and extended, so that the equal worth of all human beings becomes a stable psychological reality for us.”and the plays of Euripides were particularly well known for their engagement with contemporary events. In this case, the audience that watched The Trojan Women had recently voted to put to death the men of the rebellious colony of Melos and to enslave the women and children. Euripides invites them to contemplate the real human meaning of their actions. Compassion for the women of Troy should at least cause moral unease, reminding Athenians of the full and equal humanity of people who live in distant places, their fully human capacity for suffering. But did those imaginations really cross those lines? Think again of that invocation of Zeus. Trojans, if they worshipped Zeus as king of gods at all, surely did not refer to him as the president of the city council. The term prytanis is an Athenian legal term, completely unknown elsewhere. So it would appear that Hecuba is not a Trojan but a Greek. Her imagination is a Greek democratic (and mostly male) imagination. Maybe that’s a good thing, in the sense that the audience is surely invited to view her as their fellow and equal. But it still should give us pause. Did compassion really enable those Greeks to reach out and think about the real humanity of others, or did it stop short, allowing them to reaffirm the essential Greekness of everything that’s human? They are just us, and we are the ones who suffer humanly. Not those other ones, over in Melos. America’s towers, too, have burned. Compassion and terror are in the fabric of our lives. And now, like the Athenians, we must grapple with the fact that we have caused devastation in foreign lands. In the lives of Americans since 9/11, we do see evidence of the good work of compassion, as Americans make real to themselves the sufferings of many different people whom they never would otherwise have thought about: bereaved families of so many national and ethnic origins, even, sometimes, Arab-Americans who have suffered unfairly from airport searches and other types of mistreatment. Sometimes our compassion even crosses the national boundary. Tragedy led many people to a new awareness of the sufferings of the women of Afghanistan, and now many of us have compassion for the people of Iraq. All too often, however, the nation is the stopping place. In the New York Times issue last September [2002], commemorating 9/11, I was asked to comment on how America has changed. I wrote that Americans are becoming more curious and at least a little more knowledgeable about problems of poverty and lack of education in other parts of the world. But when my piece came out, it was on a page with about 20 other pieces, not one of which mentioned any other nation but the U. S., thus casting grave doubt, at least, on my optimistic contention. Often things are still worse: our sense that the “us” is all that matters can easily flip over into a demonizing of an imagined “them”, a group of outsiders who are imagined as enemies of the invulnerability and the pride of the all-important “us.” Just as parents’ compassion for their own children can all too easily slide into an attitude that promotes the defeat of other people’s children, so too with patriotism: compassion for our fellow Americans can all too easily slide over into an attitude that wants America to come out on top, defeating or subordinating other peoples or nations. Such attitudes have played an unfortunate role in much of the rhetoric surrounding the war with Iraq. We have been encouraged to be like sports fans cheering for our team, rather than as responsible world citizens trying to achieve a cooperative solution to our problems. How can we educate American citizens who do take seriously the reality of lives outside America, and who think of their own citizenship and its duties accordingly? Citizens who are not simply Americans, but citizens of the entire world, committed to both compassion and justice for the millions who suffer, not only from war, but from daily preventable tragedies such as malnutrition and disease? A child born in the U. S. today has life expectancy at birth of 78.6 years. A child born in Sierra Leone has life expectancy at birth of 38 years. In some African nations, 40% of the population is HIV positive, a situation perpetuated by the absence of affordable medications and suitable health infrastructure. In approximately one third of the world’s nations, less than 50% of women can read and write, a situation perpetuated by the inaction of multi-national corporations, who typically view young lives as instruments for gain, and who feel no responsibility to create educational opportunities and health care for their workforce. How can we educate American citizens who think responsibly about such problems, and America’s role in forming a world community to work on their solution? Creating compassionate world citizenship has two aspects, the institutional and the personal. These must be cultivated at the same time, and they must reinforce one another. We will not get decent public attitudes without institutions that nourish the thoughts of inclusive world citizenship. But we also will not sustain those institutions, if we do not work to produce an expanded compassion in people, so that they make real to themselves the suffering of people at a distance. The institutional aspect of world citizenship has been much discussed, and though my proposals here go very much against the grain of the present administration and its public policies, they are familiar, and therefore can be stated briefly. We should base all our dealings with other nations on the recognition that there are binding moral norms that link us all into an international society. We should work to formalize those norms through international institutions, such as the United Nations, the International Labor Organization, the World Criminal Court, multinational alliances of many kinds, and binding agreements in areas such as environment, sex equality, and the rights of children. I believe we should not aim at a world state, and that global institutions should remain plural and decentralized, in order to protect national sovereignty, an important part of people’s right to freedom and self-determination. Nonetheless, we should work to strengthen the international institutions we already have, and to create others in particular areas. We should support these institutions with a true respect for the opinions of those who differ with us. That none of these goals is currently realized in our nation’s foreign policy, skeptical as it is of moral norms, of alliances, and of any interests outside of U.S. power, should be all too obvious. It is, however, the personal and psychological side of the issue on which I want to focus for the remainder of these brief remarks. Compassion is an emotion rooted, probably, in our biological heritage. But this history does not mean that compassion is devoid of thought. In fact, as Aristotle argued long ago, human compassion standardly requires three thoughts: that a serious bad thing has happened to someone else; that this bad event was not (or not entirely) the person’s own fault; and that we ourselves are vulnerable in similar ways. Thus compassion forms a psychological link between our own self-interest and the reality of another person’s good or ill. For that reason it is a morally valuable emotion - when it gets things right. Often, however, the thoughts involved in the emotion, and therefore the emotion itself, go astray, failing to link people at a distance to one’s own current possibilities and vulnerabilities. (Rousseau said that kings don’t feel compassion for their subjects because they count on never being human, subject to the vicissitudes of life.) These errors are likely to be built into the nature of compassion as it develops in childhood: we form intense attachments to the local first, and only gradually learn to have compassion for people who are outside our immediate circle. For many Americans, that expansion of concern stops at the national boundary. Most of us are brought up to believe that all human beings have equal worth. At least the world’s major religions and most secular philosophies tell us so. But our emotions don’t believe it. We mourn for those we know, not for those we don’t know. And most of us feel deep emotions about America, emotions we don’t feel about India, or Russia, or Rwanda. In and of itself, this narrowness of our emotional lives is probably acceptable and maybe even good. We need to built outward from meanings we understand, or else our moral life would be empty of urgency. Aristotle long ago said, plausibly, that the citizens in Plato’s ideal city, asked to care for all citizens equally, would actually care for none, since care is learned in small groups with their more intense attachments. Without families and their intense loyalties, we will have, he says, a “watery” kind of care all round. Nonetheless, when we observe how narrow and partisan our compassion usually is, we must ask how it can be educated and extended, so that the equal worth of all human beings becomes a stable psychological reality for us. To begin extending compassion as best we can, we need to ask how and why local loyalties and attachments come to take in some instances an especially virulent and aggressive form, militating against a more general sympathy. I would suggest that one problem we particularly need to watch out for is a type of pathological narcissism in which the person demands complete control over all the sources of good, and a complete self-sufficiency in consequence. This pathology occurs repeatedly in human life, but perhaps it occurs with particular regularity in America, where young people are brought up to think that they are part of a nation that is on top of the world, and that they should expect to be completely in control of everything important in their lives, in consequence. Recent studies of troubled teens in America, particularly the impressive work of Dan Kindlon and Michael Thompson, in their book Raising Cain, has given strong support to this idea. Kindlon and Thompson focus on boys, and they do believe that the problems they bring to light have a gendered aspect, but they are also signs of more general cultural problems. The boys that Kindlon and Thompson study have learned from their culture that real men should be controlling, self-sufficient, dominant. They should never have, and certainly never admit to, fear and weakness. The consequence of this deformed expectation, Kindlon and Thompson show, is that these boys come to lack an understanding of their own vulnerabilities, needs and fears, weaknesses that all human beings share. They lack the language in which to characterize their own inner world, and they are by the same token clumsy interpreters of the emotions and inner lives of others. This emotional illiteracy is closely connected to aggression, as fear is turned outward, with little real understanding of the meaning of aggressive words and acts for the feelings of others. It is more than a little unfortunate that the foreign policy of our nation is at times expressed, today, in terms that reinforce these pathologies: we won’t let anyone threaten our preeminence, we’ll strike first against them, etc. So the first recommendation I would make for a culture of extended compassion is one that was also made by Rousseau. It is, that an education in common human weakness and vulnerability should be a very profound part of the education of all young people. Especially when they are at the crucial time when they are on the verge of adulthood, young people should learn to be tragic spectators, and to understand with increasing subtlety and responsiveness the predicaments to which human life is prone. Through stories and dramas, history, film, the study of philosophical and religious ethics, and the study of the global economic system, they should get the habit of decoding the suffering of another, and this decoding should deliberately lead them into lives both near and far. To be successful, this education must foster the habit of critical thinking, rooting out the inconsistencies of self-serving ethical thought; this suggests a key role for religious and secular philosophy. And it must also nourish the imagination; this suggests a key role for the arts. Third, it must offer much more knowledge of the world: the major world religions, economic conditions in developing countries, the deprivations with which a large proportion of the world’s people live from day to day. Finally, this education must take place in a culture in which materialism and greed are powerfully and pervasively criticized. World citizenship is impossible when the powerful define their humanity in terms of possessions, rather than the goods of the soul. As the Greek philosophers long ago remarked, the goods of the soul are such that we can all strive toward them harmoniously: one person’s attainment of them reinforces, and does not undermine another’s. Material goods, by contrast, always cause conflict, especially when the goal is limitless accumulation, not merely sustenance. So world citizenship, and the compassion that supports it, must be built on the goods of the soul. That is one reason why I am so honored to be here on the campus of America’s oldest and most distinguished Catholic university, and why I typically feel so much at home when I lecture in Catholic universities: because there is a shared understanding that the soul comes first, and that possessions are tools. That understanding (which is also formative in my own religion) is a non-negotiable basis for compassionate citizenship in today’s world. Are such ideas understood in our government? Not fully, I believe, even though our leadership portrays itself as Christian. On this day of celebration, let Hecuba’s cry for compassion and justice echo in our hearts, calling us to a life that challenges entrenched complacency and greed, and the violence that so often grows out of that greed, working against the recalcitrance of the world to make compassionate citizenship not just an ideal but a reality. Congratulations, may you prosper, and may you live, some day, in a world of justice for all.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"President Fainstein, Connecticut College trustees, faculty, and staff: thank you for the invitation to speak today; it’s my privilege to do so. Fellow parents and elders of today’s graduates: as one of the troubadours of our baby boomer generation, Joni Mitchell, used to sing, “We’re captives on the carousel of time.” My hope is that, as you listen to these reflections, that they’ll resonate with you and allow you to nod in recognition. Finally, most especially, members of the Class of 2003: As you can see, I’ve lugged no weighty book of wisdom to this podium. I stand before you on your special day not with answers but with questions, and with an abridged history of my 52-year-old trial-and-error American life as student, teacher, father, and fiction writer. So make of my words what you will, and also, please note that I’ve fired up the retrorockets. Fasten your seatbelts, everyone. We’re about to blast backwards into the virtual past. We’ll try a short trip first. Look, we’re here already; it’s February of 2003. The Bush administration is hard-selling the case for invasion, Home Depot is selling out of duct tape and plastic sheeting, and on the front lawns of many American homes “No War on Iraq” signs are popping up through the snow like mutant crocuses. We’re innocent, still, of the concept of “embedded” journalism and that new marketing slogan-“shock and awe”-but our initiation is upon us. Diplomacy is defunct, our leaders tell us. War is inevitable. I’m in my office when a challenge arrives via Outlook Express. The novelist Dennis Lehane has drafted a petition to President Bush which acknowledges the tyranny of Saddam Hussein but asks that all diplomatic measures be exhausted before we risk ending the lives of innocent Iraqis and American military. Lehane invites fellow writers to sign. Now, I want what Lehane wants, but I admit this to you, graduates: I blink. I walk around the office. Weigh the pros and cons of signing. There is, after all, the book buyer to consider; there’s product waiting in the warehouse at Amazon.com. Like it or not, we’re in an era of intolerance for dissenting opinion. The Dixie Chicks have yet to be beheaded, plucked, and rotisserie roasted, but the White House has cancelled a literary event where anti-war poets were to speak. In the wake of social satirist Bill Maher’s remarks about terrorism, the President’s press secretary has warned that we must all watch what we say and Maher has lost his television show. So maybe I shouldn’t sign that petition, I think. Still, my kids are watching me, listening to me, studying my responses to the world, and I do not want to send them the message that they can speak their minds at the dinner table but they had better shut up once they get into the school cafeteria. This, after all, is America, where patriotism speaks in many different voices and need not nod mutely like a smiling bobble head. And so, along with 150 other writers, among them Julia Alvarez, Amy Tan, Richard Russo, and Stephen King, I sign the petition. It’s published in the New York Times and the following day, another email arrives, this one from a reporter for a different national newspaper. He wants to know what makes me think novelists know anything about war - why I assume fiction writers have any of the answers. Hmm. Good question, Mr. Journalist. Please note that I’ve turned on the seatbelt sign. We’re heading back to the year 1961. Whether you’ve been here before or not, have a look. Dwight Eisenhower is moving out of the White House and John Kennedy’s moving in. The space race is on, our astronauts chasing Soviet cosmonauts into the heavens, while back on terra firma, Maris and Mantle are chasing the Babe’s single-season homerun record. On the small screen, a hapless man named Wilbur holds secret discourse with a talking horse named Mr. Ed, and at the movies, the Absent-Minded Professor has just invented flubber. We are still light years away from Eminem, and Nelly, and It’s getting hot in here, so take off all your clothes. No, no, our transistor radio is playing Dion & the Belmonts, who are warning against the feminine wiles of a girl named Runaround Sue and the Shirelles ask, demurely, that musical question on the mind of every teenage girl being driven in a Chevy Impala up to Lover’s Lane: “Will you still love me tomorrow?” Yet as we climb into our cuddly feet pajamas of mid-century nostalgia, let’s not forget that this is also the year that the CIA superimposes a bull’s eye on the face of Fidel Castro, feeds fiction to the public, and sends bankrolled dissidents to the Bay of Pigs to accomplish what will be a dangerously miscalculated attempt at “regime change.” Across the Atlantic, in Berlin, a 25-mile barbed wire fence is being erected to separate East from West. In response, the president pre-empts “Mr. Ed” to warn Americans that the escalating crisis may result in a Soviet nuclear attack on our soil. His speech triggers a national preoccupation with homeland security and the back yard bomb shelter, that quaint concrete cousin of the plastic and duct tape shroud, becomes the trend du jour. On the civil rights front, the Freedom Riders travel by bus from Washington to New Orleans to desegregate the South. En route, they are met with bombs and beatings by men in hoods. Because racism is a legacy, not a genetic predisposition, one of these hooded bullies will, perhaps, sire a son who will sire a son who will scrawl anonymous hate graffiti on a college bulletin board in New London, Connecticut nearly forty years hence. Racists, anti-Semites, gay-bashers, Arab-trashers: no matter what the era, no matter who the target, the hate monger is cut from the same cloth of inferior weave. But, as for me, if it’s 1961, then I am ten years old, a fifth grader living just up the road in Norwich, Connecticut. At school, I’m learning how to diagram sentences, master long division, and execute the duck-and-cover exercises which somehow will save me when the Soviets drop the bomb on the submarine base in Groton. I won’t write my first fiction for another twenty years, but the seeds of my storyteller’s life are planted this year by a scary nun named Sister Mercy. You see, my mother, who is alive again and dark-haired, insists that I attend catechism class at St. Patrick’s School each Wednesday afternoon from 3:30 to 4:30. Having already spent the day with three dozen parochial school students, Sister Mercy is not happy to see three dozen more rowdy public school students tramping in. We are equally unhappy to be there. There is acting out, screaming, rulers slapped against desktops, spitballs launched from the barrels of ballpoint pens. And as Sister patrols the aisles, one of us catechists, a wild girl named Pauline Migliaccio, goes so far as to affix a paper sign to the back of her veil. “Shake It, Don’t Break It,” the sign says, and so that you might appreciate the full-fledged audacity of Pauline’s act, may I remind you that we’re still decades away from the invention of the Post-It note. Unlike Pauline Migliaccio, I am far too timid to make trouble for Sister Mercy. My modus operandi for survival is to sit in back, say nothing, and try as best I can to blend in with the wainscoting. But on the afternoon my fate as a fiction writer is sealed, I get a strange and inexplicable urge. I want Sister to like me. Or, if she cannot like me, then at least to notice I exist. And so, at 4:30, when she intones those liberating words, “Class dismissed,” my peers lurch toward the exit, and I hang back. I stand. With a wildly thumping heart, I approach Sister’s big wooden desk. She is correcting papers and scowling–doesn’t notice at first that I stand facing her. And when she does look up, she says, “Yes, what is it?” I don’t really know what it is, but she has spent a good part of the last hour talking about the Vatican. “Sister,” I say. “My grandfather moved to America from Italy in 1890.” True. He did. Pure, unadulterated non-fiction. But I can see from Sister’s clenched face that she is unimpressed. My knees knock; my mind ricochets. Now, as it happens, earlier this same day, two of my public school classmates brought into class a papier-m?ch? volcano. They poured baking soda into the core, added vinegar, and made lava bubble up, spring forth, and dribble down the sides. And this demonstration suddenly comes to mind. “And, Sister ? before Grandpa came over? When he was still living in Italy? This volcano erupted in his town. It was early in the morning, and he was the only one awake, and so he pounded on people’s doors and everyone escaped and so he saved a whole bunch of people’s lives.” Sister’s facial muscles relax. She cocks her head. Her gold rim glasses glint a little from the light of the fluorescent lamp above. But I can see that my marriage of falsehood and fact has fallen just short of being enough. It’s a moment of truth. A moment suspended in time. Sister looks at me and waits. I look back at her and wait. And then, finally, I add: “And…the Pope gave him a medal.” She nods, she smiles. She reaches into her bottom desk drawer, removes a holy picture, and presents it to me. The following Wednesday afternoon, Sister knows my name, I have preferred seating up front, and for the rest of this school year, whenever there is need for a note to travel from Sister Mercy’s room to the office, you can probably guess who is chosen to deliver it. And so, at the tender age of ten, I learn of the rich rewards that can be yours if you take the truth and lie like hell about it. Bend it to your liking. Now, I could have become a Connecticut politician, I suppose. But no, I became, first, a teacher, and later, a fiction writer. But what do fiction writers know, Mr. Journalist has emailed me to ask. Why should anyone listen to them? Because, says Grace Paley, “A writer must be truthful. A story is a big lie. And in the middle of this big lie, you’re telling the truth.” Because, says novelist Jesamyn West, “Fiction reveals the truth that reality obscures.” “Why shouldn’t truth be stranger than fiction?” Mark Twain observes. “Fiction, after all, has to make sense.” Fast forward. It’s 1984. Ronald Reagan, Boy George, break dancing, big hair. That new NBA rookie, Michael Jordan, seems so effortlessly airborne that it’s as if he’s affixed flubber to his sneaker bottoms. I’m thirty-three now. I’ve been both a father and a fiction writer for three years; one calling has somehow unleashed the other. You see, as I study my small son Jared and try to imagine who he will grow up to become, I begin to get these characters’ voices in my head. I write down what these figments say and start to worry about them and root for their safety as if they were real. The catch is: I can only find out what’s happening to them when their voices spill from the pointy end of my Bic pen onto the loose-leaf pages in front of me. And as I work on these stories, I defy as best I can that other voice of self-inflicted doubt, which keeps whispering, Stop kidding yourself. You’re never going to get anything published. Get real. Get up from that desk and mow the lawn. But I’ve let the lawn grow and toiled away for three years and now, in 1984, the phone rings. It’s Lary Bloom, the editor of the Hartford Courant’s Northeast magazine. He wants to publish one of my short stories-the one about the fat woman, Dolores. When my conversation with the editor ends, I hang up the phone and dance my wife around the kitchen. I pick up three-year-old Jared and toss him so high into the air that his head hits the ceiling. But, hey, it’s okay because it’s one of those suspended ceilings with the lightweight panels, so Jared’s head isn’t hurt; it just disappears for a second. My short story is published on Easter Sunday. I drive at dawn to the convenience store and buy three Hartford Courants. For ten minutes, I can’t bear to look. Then I do look. I sit there by myself in the strip mall parking lot and cry like an idiot. I am on my way. Zoom zoom. It’s 1999. Kosovo, the Clinton scandal, the slaughter of students at Columbine High. My fiction has been twice-touched by the magic wand of the Oprah Winfrey Book Club, and so my character Dolores has relocated from my hard drive to the best seller list. The troubled identical twins I’ve worried into existence for my second novel have followed suit and so I am preparing to take off on a cross-country book tour. Meanwhile, Jared has metamorphosed from that airborne three year old into a 6’2” high school senior, a near-man of seventeen. He helps me heft my luggage out to the driveway where a purring limousine waits. And as I’m driven away, I look through the tinted rear window at my child and, again, I am wet-eyed. I see a young man coauthored out of love - a son who, having moved recently into his adult body, is receding from me, but who I once knew better than I know myself-better than he knew himself, certainly, because he has been, and in my mind remains, that arm-flailing infant on the changing table and the pot-bellied toddler in training pants. As he stands there in the present moment, he cannot possibly know that he is simultaneously, for me, the boy in the bowl cut clutching He-Man and Skeletor. ? the Webelos scout in the untucked uniform. ? the catcher of polliwogs in his squishy sneakers ? the afternoon paperboy, the strap of his canvas bag crossing his chest like a bandolier ? the zookeeper of a never-ending domestic menagerie: turtles, fish, fiddler crabs, two “female” gerbils-and their five or six hundred offspring. “Gee,” one of his middle school teachers had told him. “You like people and animals so much, you ought to be a biology teacher.” But at seventeen, Jared doesn’t know what he wants to be, or even where he wants to go to school next year-Bates, Bowdoin, Trinity, how’s he supposed to know? Oh, and Connecticut College is on his list. He likes that cross country coach down there, that Coach Butler. And that Coach Wuyke, too. He wouldn’t mind running for those guys. But, hey, first things first. He can’t even think of what to write for his stinking college admission essay. On my book tour, in city after city, the crowds come out. Strangers who have read my novels ask me how I knew their lives, their flaws, their family secrets. And, of course, I’ve known none of these. I’ve only gone to work each day and told the lie that I am someone other than myself: a wounded girl trying to survive rape, an Italian immigrant with an ego larger than Sicily, the frightened identical twin of a schizophrenic brother. I have, each day in solitude, shucked my own life and put on different lives so that I might move beyond the limitations of my own experience and better empathize with, better know the un-me, the other. The novelist John Edgar Wideman has said, “I seek in fiction some hint that imagination can change the world, that the world is unfinished, a hint that we are not always doomed to make copies and copies and copies but possess the power to see differently and the guts and good fortune to render accessible to others some glimmer of what our own souls experience. Stories, after all, are a gift. Unless we’re willing to imagine what it might feel like inside another skin, then we are imprisoned in our own.” By the time the limo delivers me back home again two weeks later, Jared has written his college essay. “Dad,” he says, “can you check this for spelling?” And God knows, he needs it checked. Seventeen years old and he’s still spelling the word “tomorrow” with two m’s. But as I proofread, my attention shifts from mechanics to content. I’m surprised - I’m moved - to read that my son’s essay, too, focuses on “the other”: a girl on the front page of last year’s newspaper - an innocent eleven-year old Latina named Angelica who lived in our town and who loved to dance and who was stalked, raped, and murdered by a pedophile. Angelica and Jared were strangers to one another, born seven years apart. What they had in common was that each had walked the same steps of that paper route; each had played at that polliwog-filled pond where Angelica’s body was later found. In his essay, Jared describes a solitary visit to the pond, where a granite boulder has become a makeshift memorial to Angelica. He writes: The rock appeared to be alive with color, light, and movement. Pink rosary beads, purple flowers. Expired candles coat the rock with blue, green, and orange wax and, on the ground, a few flames still flicker with life. A plain white sheet of paper is scotch-taped to the rock. In bold red letters its one word sums up all my feelings: WHY? Mr. Journalist, fiction writers have no answers, only questions, the most succinct and significant of which is: WHY? Why, God, if You exist and are merciful, must our loved ones be claimed by cancer, addiction, AIDS, mental illness, muscular dystrophy, murder? Why, America, if justice is blind, do we imprison the descendants of slaves in such disproportionate numbers? Why must our poorest children get the poorest education and our hungriest be denied a place at the banquet table? Why, suicide bomber? Why? Tough questions, graduates. Unanswerable, many of them, no matter what your major - no matter what your grade point average. And yet, we grope, we struggle to understand why. That struggle, I believe, is what makes us not just human but humane. And it can be a noble struggle when accompanied by a rejection of the unacceptable, unimaginative status quo and an honest effort to change things for the better. But how to improve an imperfect world, an imperfect nation, our imperfect selves? That question has occupied the minds of scholars, scientists, artists, and activists throughout time-and has sometimes?sometimes?been the pebble in the shoe that becomes the unbearable pain that motivates good minds and generous hearts to bring their gifts to the table, roll up their sleeves, and fix things. Graduates, be a part of that. Find work that adds to the world instead of depleting it. You owe that to yourselves, and to those descendants whose DNA you store inside you, and to the descendants of the un-you, the other. Here we are back at the station-back in the uneasy present. What’s that line from The Matrix? “Welcome to the desert of the real.” As for the future, you’ll have to get there yourselves. But before you depart, I offer you a modest travel gift: these few things a father and fiction writer knows. Aubrey, Vlado, Maylynn, Britt: In life, as in writing, voice is crucial. Your voice has been honed by your family, your ethnic heritage, your neighborhood, and your education. It is the music of your meaning in the world. Imitate no one. Your uniqueness-your authenticity-is your strength. Sarah, Oslec, Miranda, John: Make yours a life story which is character-driven, not plot-driven, character being defined as the way you behave when there is no one else in the room to judge you. Don’t fear that silent room. Solitude will guide you if you remain strong of character. Meghan, Justin, Alex, Joe: Learn to love the editing process. Listen to criticism, welcome it with gratitude and humility, but beware the false critic with a covert agenda. Make mistakes, lots of them, reworking draft after draft after draft of your continuing story. Your errors will be educational, and if your pencil outlives its eraser, then you’ll know you’re getting it right. Clancy, Becca, Mridula, Jose: Regarding plot-the twists and turns and episodes of your life-outline as much or as little as you like, but expect surprise. In fact, invite surprise. Each time you begin some next chapter, your composition of yourself will be at risk. But that’s okay-that’s good-because you will not live fully if you never displace yourself. “Writing a novel is like driving a car at night,” E.L. Doctorow once said. “You may be able to see only as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.” And finally, Jared, a personal word to you: You have been a most enjoyable child to raise. Levelheaded, playful, kind to others, you’ve made few missteps, and no unforgivable ones, with the exception of that time you rented that white tux, tails, and top hat for your senior prom. As you prepare now to board the bus-to take the Freedom Ride down to New Orleans to teach biology in one of the most forsaken school districts in the nation-please know that your family loves you and is proud of you and the work you’ve chosen. Keep in mind that the best teachers are the ones who love the student as much as the subject matter-the ones who stop speaking long enough to listen. Teaching will teach you, again and again, that you are the other and the other is you, despite the barriers we erect and the bombs we drop. Draw strength from the knowledge that education will break the backs of poverty, disenfranchisement, and violence; that war is never inevitable but only a terrible failure of the imagination; and that love is stronger than hatred. As it says so beautifully in Corinthians: As a child, I saw it face to face Now I only know it in part Fractions in me of faith, hope, and love And of these three, love’s the greatest beauty So, Jared, Vaya con Dios. Be well. Be safe. And know that, in the end, I wrote these words not for Mr. Journalist but for you, and your classmates, and Angelica, together.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"If I bear in mind the syllabus with which the class of 2003 has been engaged over the last four years, I don’t know how else to think of your invitation to deliver a commencement speech except as the proverbial praise from Caesar. I count it both as an honor and as a piece of luck because I’m always glad of the chance to try for an answer to the question, “What in God’s name are the humanities, and why are they of any use to us here in the bright blue, technological wonder of the 21st Century?” The standard set of answers read like funeral orations-newspaper columnists mourning the death of western civilization, editors of alumni magazines likening the humanities to a suite of virgins set upon by Philistines or dogs, college deans talking about the precious ornaments of ancient art and modern literature buried in the tomb of a medieval library. The sanctimony is traditional, and invariably reminds me of a poem by Archibald MacLeish, “Freedom that was a thing to use, they’ve made a thing to save, and dug round and fenced it in, like a dead man’s grave.” A mistake to think of the humanities as luxuries, or as a decent appearance that must be kept up, like the country club membership or the house in Palm Beach. Necessities. I can think of no other set of studies more relevantto our present circumstance. Our techologists bear comparison to the sorcerer’s apprentice, producing continuously improved means toward increasingly ill-defined ends. Unless we look to the humanities to clean up the mess, we stand a better than even chance of killing ourselves with our new toys. In its Renaissance usages, the word humanist connotes resourcefulness, skepticism, irony, and self-reliance, “refinement without extravagance and knowledge without effeminacy.” A character played by Robert Mitchum or Humphrey Bogart, not by Hugh Grant; more to do with the cunning of Ulysses, great-hearted and wide-wandering, than with the dithering of the cultural endowments in Washington, or with the intrigues behind the arras of the English Department at Yale. Humanism is about the passion of thought and the will to understand, about Darwin sailing for the Galapagos or Dostoevski in trouble with the police, about Condorcet dying in a garret and hunted by agents of the guillotine, writing his outline of human progress so that he might hearten mankind by his vision of its possible perfections. The imaginative taking of experience of the past can be put through as many paces as a well-trained circus horse, and when I’m at a loss to remember why I read Tacitus or Moilière I think of the magician Merlin in T. H. White’s Once and Future King, seated under a willow tree and presenting the young Prince Arthur with a certain cure for melancholy: “The best thing for being sad is to learn something. That is the only thing that never fails. You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only love, you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your honour trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for it then-to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never dream of regretting.” Among my own teachers, the one nearest in spirit to T. H. White’s Merlin turned up forty years ago under a potted palm tree in a New York City restaurant under the name of Otto Friedrich. In the heyday of what was then called “The New Journalism,” Otto was the managing editor of The Saturday Evening Post, and I was one of the magazine’s newly recruited contract writers. When I first met him in the autumn of 1962 he seemed a remote and professorial figure-tall and heavy-set but with the stooped posture of a man accustomed to bending over books, taciturn, unsentimental, and matter-of-fact, given to wearing the same rumpled suit for days on end, not yet fifty but seeming as old as Merlin’s owl. Over the course of the next five years, listening to him talk about the last months of the Roman Empire or Mozart’s attachment to the key of E flat with the same degree of certainty that he brought to a discussion of the Kennedy Administration’s geopolitical game theory, I understood that he joined a scholar’s love of learning with a journalist’s boundless curiosity. Free of cant and incapable of hypocrisy, Otto taught by example instead of by precept, patiently and with an unstinting kindness that he took a good deal of trouble to conceal behind a show of churlishness. He was as suspicious of metaphors as he was of politicians, and because he was a better writer than all but a few (a very few) of the more famous authors whose work he ushered into the light of print. I seldom quarreled with his judgment. Otto never indulged a writer with the sloppy display of adjectives that he associated with publishers’ blurbs and lipstick advertisements, and the best that could be hoped for was that the manuscript might pass inspection without attracting a scourge of marginal notes (“empty phrase,” “wrong word,” “absurdity”) that indicated not only a redrafting of the text but also the jettisoning of its presumed topic. By the time the Post ceased publication in the spring of 1969 I had come to recognize him as a man who summed up in his life and turn of mind what I take to be the meaning of the word “humanist.” Over the course of a life that didn’t allow him much time to write, he published fourteen books, and when he died at the age of sixty-six in 1995, he had a list of twenty other books in mind, among them biographies of Richard Wagner, St. Paul, and Attila the Hun, a man whom he regarded as “much misunderstood, and far more worthy than his Roman enemy.” Otto wrote books in the way that other people wander off into forests, chasing his intellectual enthusiasms as if they were obscure butterflies or rare mushrooms-books about roses and Eduard Manet’s Olympia, extended essays about Scarlatti, the Albigensian Crusade, the siege of Monte Cassino and the fires of Auschwitz, books about Berlin in the 1920’s and Hollywood in the 1940’s, biographies of Glenn Gould and Helmuth von Moltke– An historian in the amateur tradition of Henry Adams, Bernard DeVoto and Walter Karp. Otto ignored the apparatus of academic scholarship, and approached the study of history in the same spirit that he approached Mozart’s piano concertos. “The only way to understand a Mozart concerto thoroughly,” he once said, “is to sit down at the piano and play it, which I do with his number twenty-seven, humbly, every six months or so.” Otto was never at a loss for a story to tell, if not about drifting ships then about earthquakes, or flowering trees, or the company of the Christian miracles gathered on the island of Iona. His life was not without sorrow-two of his children born disabled, his right eye gone blind with disease, none of his books profitable enough to release him from his chores as an editor, a siege of mental illness so severe that for a year it brought him near insanity-but like the Merlin imagined by T. H. White, he found that the best thing for being sad was to learn something. Although he was well-versed in the “trembling of the anatomies”, I never once heard him complain of his misfortunes, and I suspect that he had little liking or patience for the kind of people-quite a few of them writers of large reputation-who display their afflictions as if they were made of gold lace. Otto believed that we are all caught up in the telling of stories (some more complicated and more beautiful than others, many of them incoherent, a few of them immortal), and he assumed that no matter how well or how poorly we manage the plot, we are all of us engaged in the same enterprise, all of us seeking evocations or representations of what we can recognize as appropriately human. On the afternoon of May 24, 1995 in Saint Peter’s Church on Lexington Avenue in New York City the memorial service began with the playing of Bach’s Goldberg Variations, and as I listened to the theme presenting itself in a succession of different rhythms and voices, I thought of Otto setting the libretto of human feeling to the counterpoint of time. The music shifted to an aria from Richard Strauss’s Der Rosenkavalier, and I remembered that two years before going to Paris in the summer of 1948, Otto had traveled around Europe to pay his respects to various artists in whose work he had found inspiration. “Barging in on living monuments,” he once said, “a tourist collecting a generation.” At Rappallo in the north of Italy Otto invited himself to tea with Sir Max and Lady Beerbohm; in Rome he found George Santayana, reclining in striped pajamas on his bed at the Convent of the Blue Nuns. In Munich he briefly took piano lessons with Georg Pembauer, who was said to have been a pupil of Liszt, and on the terrace of the Grand Hotel in Lausanne, he accosted Richard Strauss, by then a bent and white-haired man of eighty-two, with the first pages of a piano concerto he had begun to write on the voyage from New York. The elderly lady accompanying the composer on his afternoon walk angrily waved Otto out of sight, never guessing what it was that Otto had come to say or that forty-nine years later, on Lexington Avenue and East 53rd Street, the music of Der Rosenkavalier would oversee the departure of Otto’s civilizing spirit. Within the profession of journalism I often have heard it said that the truth shall make men free, but it was Otto who taught me what the phrase means. The truth isn’t about the acquisition of doctrine or the assimilation of statistics, not even about the chicanery in Washington or the scandal in Santa Monica. It’s about the courage to trust one’s own thought and observation, to possess one’s own history, speak in one’s own voice. Most of Otto’s books never sold more than a few thousand copies, but although he knew that the reading and writing of history settles nothing (neither the grocer’s bill, the argument in the faculty lounge, nor next year’s election), he also knew that the study of history is the proof of our kinship with a larger whole and a wider self, with those who have gone before and those who will come after, and that we have nothing else with which to build the future except the wreckage of the past. Time destroys all things, but from the ruin of families and empires we preserve what we find useful or beautiful or true, on our way to death we make of what we have found the hope of our immortality. Stories move from truth to facts, not the other way around, but in the attempt to convey the essence of a thing the teller of tales must give it a name, an age and an address, and when I see the world devastated by evil lunatics, I think of Otto Friedrich, sick or in pain, blind in one eye, playing Bach’s Partita in C Minor on a winter night on a piano badly out of tune, planning his next raid on the kingdom of the past, wondering how he might hearten himself and his fellow men with a story not yet told. Most of what I know about the composition of English prose I learned from Otto Friedrich, who also gave me to understand that very few of the world’s powers can do you irreparable harm if you don’t make the mistake of running a con-game on the unique character and specific temper of your own mind, and that most of the political arguments going forward in the world at the present moment are the same ones that enlivened the scaffolds of Renaissance Italy annals of Imperial Rome-the old and bitter quarrel between time past and time future, between the inertia of things as they are and the energy inherent in the hope of things as they might become. The former and more portly faction invariably commands the popular majority. It is the party of military parades and “Late Night with David Letterman”, of Time magazine, Steven Spielberg movies, and the oil company lobbyists working the halls of Congress. All of you belong, by definition if not by choice, to the party of things-as-they-might-become. Don’t underestimate the guile of your enemies. The servants of the status quo like to say that nothing is seriously amiss, that this is the best of all possible worlds, that the wisdom in office, whether at the White House or on the set of “Nightline”, brooks neither impertinence nor contradiction. The authorities rest the case for their assurance on two lines of false reasoning. First, that the future is so dangerous that only football captains need apply, that everything is very difficult, very complicated and very far beyond the grasp of mere mortals who never have sailed up the Nile with Henry Kissinger. Second, that because this is the best of all possible worlds, nothing important remains to be said or discovered. The media have a hand in both of these deceptions, and I speak from some experience when I say that the fear of the future sells newspapers and bids up the market for cheap miracles and expensive cosmetics. The enormous acquisitions and disseminations of knowledge over the past twenty years (about nuclear physics, cancer cells, the history of Germany, terrorism, and the chemistry of bats) have brought forth corresponding gains in the levels of anxiety. Hardly a day passes without somebody naming yet another substance (previously thought to be harmless) that can kill or maim everybody in downtown Los Angeles. The evil omens decorate the seven-o’clock news, and every self-respecting newsletter announces the depletion of the reserves of deutschemarks, sunlight and conscience. The seers who look into the abyss of the millennium predict catastrophes appropriate to the fears of the audiences they have been paid to alarm. During the span of a single week at Harper’s Magazine I once received the galley-proofs of three new books entitled, in order of their arrival, “The End of Nature,” “The End of Science” and “The End of History.” The rumors are as exaggerated as the ones about Saddam Hussein’s inventory of nuclear weapons. It is the business of the future to be dangerous, and most of the people who magnify its risks do so for reasons of their own. Jealous of a future apt to render them ridiculous or irrelevant, they bear comparison to the French noblewoman, a duchess in her eighties, who, on seeing the first ascent of Montgolfier’s balloon from the palace of the Tuilleries in 1783, fell back upon the cushions of her carriage and wept. “Oh yes,” she said, “Now it’s certain. One day they’ll learn how to keep people alive forever, but I shall already be dead.” To disprove the second proposition, you have only to consult the listings in any newspaper-any week, any edition-to know that the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are still at large on five continents and seven oceans. The headlines give the lie to the assertion that the servants of the status quo know why the word wags, and who or what wags it. Quite clearly, almost everything remains to be done, said or discovered; also quite clearly, the world stands in need of as much help as it can get, and if it doesn’t get that help from people like yourselves, then in whom does it place the hope of a new answer, or even better, a new question. As a student at Yale in the 1950’s I was taught to think of the 20th Century as the miraculous and happy ending of the story of human progress; I now think of it as a still primitive beginning. From the perspective of the 30th Century, I expect the historians to look back upon the works of our modern world as if upon sand castles built by surprisingly gifted children. When I was your age I made the mistake of imagining the future as a destination-like Paris or Baltimore or the Gobi Desert, and I thought that in the so-called real world the people who ran the place were made of Greek marble or Gothic stone. As I grew older I began to notice, first to my surprise, and then to my alarm, that the more loudly the Wizards of Oz claimed to know all the answers the less likely that they knew even a few of the questions. The walls of the establishment are made of paper, as often as not the fortress manned by soldiers already dead, propped like sandbags on the parapets of office. The party of things-as-they-are stages a great show of its magnificence in order to conceal its weakness and fear, and it makes small complaint if all the voters in California, New York and Michigan wander through their lives in a passive stupor. As a nation we now spend upwards of $500 billion a year on liquor, pornography and drugs, and the Cold War against the American intellect constitutes a more profitable business than the old arrangement with the Russians or the new arrangement with the viceroys of terrorist Jihad. The discussions in the newspapers about the sorrows of American education assume the existence of what the editorial writers like to call “the educated citizen.” To the best of my knowledge I have never met such a person; even the idea of an educated citizen strikes me as preposterous. I can conceive of a self-educating citizen, and I have had the good fortune to meet a number of people who can be so described, none of them fool enough to proclaim themselves educated. Without exception they possess the valor of their ignorance, conceiving of education neither as a blessed state of being (comparable to membership in the Cosmos Club) nor as a material good sold in a store (even at Harvard’s rate of $34,000 per annum) but rather as a ceaseless process of learning and re-learning. Few pleasures equal the joy of the mind when it’s being put to constructive and imaginative use, and if not to people like those of you on this lawn, to whom do we turn for a new equation, a new line of economic or political theory, a new lyric and a new song? Mark Twain referred to such people as “the makers of the earth after God,” and you are lucky enough to have inherited not only the writings of Twain but also the mechanism of democratic self-government. Democracy allies itself with change and proceeds under the assumption that nobody knows enough, that nothing is final, that the old order (whether of men and women or institutions) will be carried off-stage every twenty years. The plurality of democratic voices and forms assumes a ceaseless making and re-making-of laws and customs as well as of fortunes and matinee idols. Democratic government is a purpose held in common, and if it can be understood as a set of temporary coalitions among people of different interests, skills and generations, then everybody has need of everybody else. To the extent that a democratic society gives its citizens the chance to chase its own dreams, it gives itself the chance not only of discovering its multiple glories and triumphs, but also of surviving its multiple follies and crimes. No matter what the season’s top billings in the American political circus, the argument between the past and future tense falls along the division between the people who would continue the democratic experiment and those who think that the experiment has gone far enough. The freedom of thought and expression presents society with the unwelcome news that it is in trouble, but because all societies, like most individuals, are always in some kind of trouble, the news doesn’t cause them to perish. They die instead from the fear of thought and the paralysis that accompanies the wish to make time stand still. Liberty has ambitious enemies, but the survival of the American democracy depends less on the size of its armies than on the capacity of its individual citizens to think for themselves. Tyranny never has much trouble drumming up the smiles of prompt agreement, but a democracy stands in need of as many questions as it can ask of its own stupidity and fear. Idealism rescues cynicism, and the continued comfort of the party of things-as-they-are depends on the doubts placed under their pillows by the party of things-as-they-might-become. The future turns out to be something that you make instead of find. It isn’t waiting for your arrival, either with an arrest warrant or a band, nor is it any further away than the next sentence, the next best guess, the next sketch for the painting of a life portrait that might become a masterpiece. The future is an empty canvas or a blank sheet of paper, and if you have the courage of your own thought and your own observation you can make of it what you will.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"Members of the class of 1998: In an effort to alter history, I would like to give you students a commencement speech that is both memorable and useful. It consists of a list of jobs that are readily available to young college graduates, but are rarely , if ever, considered to be within their reach. The mistake made by most of you is that you aim too low - assistants to administrative assistants and the like - whereas the positions I am about to describe are not only exalted and high paying; they also require little or no work, experience, training or knowledge. Thus they are exceptionally well suited to graduating seniors. Here, then, is a sort of ‘unclassifieds’ of exciting opportunities waiting for you: President of the United States. This job is often avoided by students because it necessitates living in Washington and has an age requirement. But the position is very worthwhile. Recent grads would make excellent U.S. Presidents because they usually are single, and can get into less trouble than a married President. The “work” does not require that one have been President of some other place, like China. And it lasts eight years at most, after which you’ll have plenty of time for golf and dating. Perks include free food, you own seal, protection by the Secret Service (when they’re not out testifying), and a loyal staff, consisting of such people as Dick Morris and Linda Tripp. Drug Czar. A most enjoyable and relaxing job, it has the added distinction of being the only government post named for a Russian. Its best feature is that while it requires no effort, it also demands no successes. As drug czar all you need to do is claim, every few months, that you are eradicating the nation’s drug problem. Everyone will understand that you’re kidding. The person who accomplished the least in this position, and was therefore the most successful, was William Bennett, who was equally successful as Secretary of Education, an office that he recommended be abolished once he left it. Mr. Bennett is currently the spokesperson for national morality. Spokesperson. It’s easy. I’s fun. And it could be you! Simply find someone in the news, preferably under indictment, and do all his/her public speaking. In no time, you will be that someone in the news. Then you can hire a spokesperson. Infinite possibilities. Expert Expert. When an individual mishap occurs, and the press wishes to suggest that it signifies a national epidemic, who they gonna’ call? As a expert expert, simply be prepared to show up on TV and warn the public about the ‘lessons’ of everything from frostbite to shark attacks. Make something out of nothing! Offer solutions! Create jobs for others! Historian. You probably think that becoming a historian demands a Ph.D. and long study, but today anyone may be so designated if he/she remembers anything. Recent grads may become historians if they, say remember the ’80s. You can appear on your own cable channel, and rake in big fees on the lecture circuit. But you will have the most fun simply making up history. Who will correct you? Did somebody say ‘Professor’? Talk-Show Host. (See President of the United States.) Celine Dion. Claim to be Celine Dion. She’s everywhere, so who’ll know? Only requirement is that you sing the love song from Titanic all year. Your career will go on and on. Plagiarist. Talk about easy! Why write your own material when others have done it for you? With careful choices, a good plagiarist can produce dozens of articles or books a year and make a fortune. Don’t worry about being caught. If you have to apologize, just say, ‘An error was made.’ Nobody cares. Media Critic. Now here’s a job you can do at home. You don’t even need to have been a model member of the media to criticize them (see Plagiarist), and many find they are better at it in inverse proportion to their abilities. The ‘work’ is not only easy but also exclusive; no one but members of the media will pay attention! With luck you can join the faculty of a journalism school and take a whole year ‘teaching’ a ‘subject’ that a slow 12 year-old could pick up in three weeks. Publishing Giant. As long as you don’t hold the fuddy-duddy notion of books as literature, you can be a publishing giant (and be invited to all the best parties!) without lifting a finger. Simply sign up a major criminal or disgraced public figure to a lucrative book contract. That’s it! You don’t even need to produce the book. Who’ll notice? Eventually you may be fired, but think of all the celebrities you’ll rub elbows with. And you can always become a media critic or historian. Celebrity Lawyer. Time was when new law-school grads had to suffer years of obscurity laboring in the stacks of some stuffy firm. Now you can go straight to TV and be rich and famous instantly. Just be sure to shout, interrupt and call your opponents idiots. Do not expect to achieve the charm or personal appeal of a Alan Dershowitz or a Marcia Lark right away. But in a very short time you’ll be building a name for yourself and a clientele! Why chase ambulances when the ambulance can come to you? There you go. Congratulations and good luck. Remember: there’s a great country out there. Take it.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"President Walsh, trustees, faculty, friends, noble parents…and dear class of 1996, I am so proud of you. Thank you for asking me to speak to you today. I had a wonderful time trying to imagine who had been ahead of me on the list and had said no; I was positive you’d have to have gone to Martha Stewart first. And I meant to call her to see what she would have said, but I forgot. She would probably be up here telling you how to turn your lovely black robes into tents. I will try to be at least as helpful, if not quite as specific as that. I’m very conscious of how easy it is to let people down on a day like this, because I remember my own graduation from Wellesley very, very well, I am sorry to say. The speaker was Santha Rama Rau who was a woman writer, and I was going to be a woman writer. And in fact, I had spent four years at Wellesley going to lectures by women writers hoping that I would be the beneficiary of some terrific secret – which I never was. And now here I was at graduation, under these very trees, absolutely terrified. Something was over. Something safe and protected. And something else was about to begin. I was heading off to New York and I was sure that I would live there forever and never meet anyone and end up dying one of those New York deaths where no one even notices you’re missing until the smell drifts into the hallway weeks later. And I sat here thinking, “O.K., Santha, this is my last chance for a really terrific secret, lay it on me,” and she spoke about the need to place friendship over love of country, which I must tell you had never crossed my mind one way or the other. I want to tell you a little bit about my class, the class of 1962. When we came to Wellesley in the fall of 1958, there was an article in the Harvard Crimson about the women’s colleges, one of those stupid mean little articles full of stereotypes, like girls at Bryn Mawr wear black. We were girls then, by the way, Wellesley girls. How long ago was it? It was so long ago that while I was here, Wellesley actually threw six young women out for lesbianism. It was so long ago that we had curfews. It was so long ago that if you had a boy in your room, you had to leave the door open six inches, and if you closed the door you had to put a sock on the doorknob. In my class of, I don’t know, maybe 375 young women, there were six Asians and 5 Blacks. There was a strict quota on the number of Jews. Tuition was $2,000 a year and in my junior year it was raised to $2,250 and my parents practically had a heart attack. How long ago? If you needed an abortion, you drove to a gas station in Union, New Jersey with $500 in cash in an envelope and you were taken, blindfolded, to a motel room and operated on without an anesthetic. On the lighter side, and as you no doubt read in the New York Times magazine, and were flabbergasted to learn, there were the posture pictures. We not only took off most of our clothes to have our posture pictures taken, we took them off without ever even thinking, this is weird, why are we doing this? – not only that, we had also had speech therapy – I was told I had a New Jersey accent I really ought to do something about, which was a shock to me since I was from Beverly Hills, California and had never set foot in the state of New Jersey… not only that, we were required to take a course called Fundamentals, Fundies, where we actually were taught how to get in and out of the back seat of the car. Some of us were named things like Winkie. We all parted our hair in the middle. How long ago was it? It was so long ago that among the things that I honestly cannot conceive of life without, that had not yet been invented: panty hose, lattes, Advil, pasta (there was no pasta then, there was only spaghetti and macaroni) – I sit here writing this speech on a computer next to a touch tone phone with an answering machine and a Rolodex, there are several CD’s on my desk, a bottle of Snapple, there are felt-tip pens and an electric pencil sharpener… well, you get the point, it was a long time ago. Anyway, as I was saying, the Crimson had this snippy article which said that Wellesley was a school for tunicata – tunicata apparently being small fish who spend the first part of their lives frantically swimming around the ocean floor exploring their environment, and the second part of their lives just lying there breeding. It was mean and snippy, but it had the horrible ring of truth, it was one of those do-not-ask-for-whom-the-bell-tolls things, and it burned itself into our brains. Years later, at my 25th reunion, one of my classmates mentioned it, and everyone remembered what tunacata were, word for word. My class went to college in the era when you got a masters degrees in teaching because it was “something to fall back on” in the worst case scenario, the worst case scenario being that no one married you and you actually had to go to work. As this same classmate said at our reunion, “Our education was a dress rehearsal for a life we never led.” Isn’t that the saddest line? We weren’t meant to have futures, we were meant to marry them. We weren’t’ meant to have politics, or careers that mattered, or opinions, or lives; we were meant to marry them. If you wanted to be an architect, you married an architect. Non Ministrare sed Ministrari – you know the old joke, not to be ministers but to be ministers’ wives. I’ve written about my years at Wellesley, and I don’t want to repeat myself any more than is necessary. But I do want to retell one anecdote from the piece I did about my 10th Wellesley reunion. I’ll tell it a little differently for those of you who read it. Which was that, during my junior year, when I was engaged for a very short period of time, I thought I might transfer to Barnard my senior year. I went to see my class dean and she said to me, “Let me give you some advice. You’ve worked so hard at Wellesley, when you marry, take a year off. Devote yourself to your husband and your marriage.” Of course it was stunning piece of advice to give me because I’d always intended to work after college. My mother was a career women, and all of us, her four daughters, grew up understanding that the question, “What do you want to be when you grow up?” was as valid for girls as for boys. Take a year off being a wife. I always wondered what I was supposed to do in that year. Iron? I repeated the story for years, as proof that Wellesley wanted its graduates to be merely housewives. But I turned out to be wrong, because years later I met another Wellesley graduate who had been as hell-bent on domesticity as I had been on a career. And she had gone to the same dean with the same problem, and the dean had said to her, “Don’t have children right away. Take a year to work.” And so I saw that what Wellesley wanted was for us to avoid the extremes. To be instead, that thing in the middle. A lady. We were to take the fabulous education we had received here and use it to preside at dinner table or at a committee meeting, and when two people disagreed we would be intelligent enough to step in and point out the remarkable similarities between their two opposing positions. We were to spend our lives making nice. Many of my classmates did exactly what they were supposed to when they graduated from Wellesley, and some of them, by the way, lived happily ever after. But many of them didn’t. All sorts of things happened that no one expected. They needed money so they had to work. They got divorced so they had to work. They were bored witless so they had to work. The women’s movement came along and made harsh value judgments about their lives – judgments that caught them by surprise, because they were doing what they were supposed to be doing, weren’t they? The rules had changed, they were caught in some kind of strange time warp. They had never intended to be the heroines of their own lives, they’d intended to be – what? – First Ladies, I guess, first ladies in the lives of big men. They ended up feeling like victims. They ended up, and this is really sad, thinking that their years in college were the best years of their lives. Why am I telling you this? It was a long time ago, right? Things have changed, haven’t they? Yes, they have. But I mention it because I want to remind you of the undertow, of the specific gravity. American society has a remarkable ability to resist change, or to take whatever change has taken place and attempt to make it go away. Things are different for you than they were for us. Just the fact that you chose to come to a single-sex college makes you smarter than we were – we came because it’s what you did in those days – and the college you are graduating from is a very different place. All sorts of things caused Wellesley to change, but it did change, and today it’s a place that understands its obligations to women in today’s world. The women’s movement has made a huge difference, too, particularly for young women like you. There are women doctors and women lawyers. There are anchorwomen, although most of them are blonde. But at the same time, the pay differential between men and women has barely changed. In my business, the movie business, there are many more women directors, but it’s just as hard to make a movie about women as it ever was, and look at the parts the Oscar-nominated actresses played this year: hooker, hooker, hooker, hooker, and nun. It’s 1996, and you are graduating from Wellesley in the Year of the Wonderbra. The Wonderbra is not a step forward for women. Nothing that hurts that much is a step forward for women. What I’m saying is, don’t delude yourself that the powerful cultural values that wrecked the lives of so many of my classmates have vanished from the earth. Don’t let the New York Times article about the brilliant success of Wellesley graduates in the business world fool you – there’s still a glass ceiling. Don’t let the number of women in the work force trick you – there are still lots of magazines devoted almost exclusively to making perfect casseroles and turning various things into tents. Don’t underestimate how much antagonism there is toward women and how many people wish we could turn the clock back. One of the things people always say to you if you get upset is, don’t take it personally, but listen hard to what’s going on and, please, I beg you, take it personally. Understand: every attack on Hillary Clinton for not knowing her place is an attack on you. Underneath almost all those attacks are the words: get back, get back to where you once belonged. When Elizabeth Dole pretends that she isn’t serious about her career, that is an attack on you. The acquittal of O.J. Simpson is an attack on you. Any move to limit abortion rights is an attack on you – whether or not you believe in abortion. The fact that Clarence Thomas is sitting on the Supreme Court today is an attack on you. Above all, be the heroine of your life, not the victim. Because you don’t have the alibi my class had – this is one of the great achievements and mixed blessings you inherit: unlike us, you can’t say nobody told you there were other options. Your education is a dress rehearsal for a life that is yours to lead. Twenty-five years from now, you won’t have as easy a time making excuses as my class did. You won’t be able to blame the deans, or the culture, or anyone else: you will have no one to blame but yourselves. Whoa. So what are you going to do? This is the season when a clutch of successful women – who have it all – give speeches to women like you and say, to be perfectly honest, you can’t have it all. Maybe young women don’t wonder whether they can have it all any longer, but in case of you are wondering, of course you can have it all. What are you going to do? Everything, is my guess. It will be a little messy, but embrace the mess. It will be complicated, but rejoice in the complications. It will not be anything like what you think it will be like, but surprises are good for you. And don’t be frightened: you can always change your mind. I know: I’ve had four careers and three husbands. And this is something else I want to tell you, one of the hundreds of things I didn’t know when I was sitting here so many years ago: you are not going to be you, fixed and immutable you, forever. We have a game we play when we’re waiting for tables in restaurants, where you have to write the five things that describe yourself on a piece of paper. When I was your age, I would have put: ambitious, Wellesley graduate, daughter, Democrat, single. Ten years later not one of those five things turned up on my list. I was: journalist, feminist, New Yorker, divorced, funny. Today not one of those five things turns up in my list: writer, director, mother, sister, happy. Whatever those five things are for you today, they won’t make the list in ten years – not that you still won’t be some of those things, but they won’t be the five most important things about you. Which is one of the most delicious things available to women, and more particularly to women than to men. I think. It’s slightly easier for us to shift, to change our minds, to take another path. Yogi Berra, the former New York Yankee who made a specialty of saying things that were famously maladroit, quoted himself at a recent commencement speech he gave. “When you see a fork in the road,” he said, “take it.” Yes, it’s supposed to be a joke, but as someone said in a movie I made, don’t laugh this is my life, this is the life many women lead: two paths diverge in a wood, and we get to take them both. It’s another of the nicest things about being women; we can do that. Did I say it was hard? Yes, but let me say it again so that none of you can ever say the words, nobody said it was so hard. But it’s also incredibly interesting. You are so lucky to have that life as an option. Whatever you choose, however many roads you travel, I hope that you choose not to be a lady. I hope you will find some way to break the rules and make a little trouble out there. And I also hope that you will choose to make some of that trouble on behalf of women. Thank you. Good luck. The first act of your life is over. Welcome to the best years of your lives.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"In a sensible world I would now congratulate the Class of 1995 and sit down without further comment. I am sure the Class of 1995 wishes I would do so. Unfortunately for the Class of 1995 we do not live in a sensible world. We live in a world far more slavish in its obedience to ancient custom than we like to admit. And ancient commencement-day custom demands that somebody stand up here and harangue the poor graduates until they beg for mercy. The ancient rule has been: make them suffer. I still remember the agony of my own graduation at The John Hopkins University. They had imported some heat from the Sahara Desert especially for the occasion, and the commencement orator spoke for two and a half days. That was in 1947. Luckily, the forces of mercy have made big gains since then. The authorities of Connecticut College have suggested that for me to speak longer than 20 minutes would be regarded as cruel and inhuman punishment and that if I go as long as 30 minutes several strong men will mount this platform and forcibly remove me. But if I can finish in 15 minutes - 15 minutes! - they will let me stay for lunch. They know their man, ladies and gentleman. When I smell a free lunch, I go for it. So if I can do this right, you’ll see the back of me before we get to minute 16. This will not be easy. Condensing a graduation speech into 15 minutes is like trying to squeeze a Wagnerian opera into a telephone booth. To do it I had to strip away all the frills. This means you don’t even get any warm-up jokes. So those of you who came just for the jokes might as well leave now. All right, let’s plunge right ahead into the dull part. That’s the part where the commencement speaker tells the graduates to go forth into the world, then gives advice on what to do when they get out there. This is a ridiculous waste of time. The graduates never take the advice, as I have learned from long experience. The best advice I can give anybody about going out into the world is this: Don’t do it. I have been out there. It is a mess. I have been giving graduates this advice ever since 1967 when I spoke to a batch of them over at Bennington. That was 28 years ago. Some of your parent were probably graduating there that day and went on to ignore my advice. Thanks to the genius of my generation, I told them, it was a pretty good world out there - they went forth into it, they would mess it up. So I urged them not to go. I might as well have been shouting down a rain barrel. They didn’t listen. They went forth anyhow. And look what happened. Within a year Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were murdered. Then Nixon took us all to The Watergate. Draft riots. Defeat in Vietnam. John Lennon killed. Ronald Reagan and his trillion-dollar deficit. Over the years I spoke to many graduating classes, always pleading with them: Whatever you do, do not go forth. Nobody listened. They kept right on going forth anyhow. And look what we have today: Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton. So I will not waste my breath today pleading with you not to go forth. Instead I limit myself to a simple plea: When you get out there in the world try not to make it any worse than it already is. I thought it might help to give you a list of the hundred most important things you can do to avoid making the world any worse. Since I’m shooting for 15 minutes, however, there is no time to give you all 100. You will have to make do with 10. Short as the public attention span is these days, nobody could remember 100 anyhow. Even 10 may be asking too much. You remember the old joke about how television news would have reported the story of the Ten Commandments: “God today issued 10 commandments, three of which are…” He is my list: 10 things to help you avoid making the world worse than it already is. One: Bend down once in a while and smell a flower. Two: Don’t go around in clothes that talk. There is already too much talk in the world. We’ve got so many talking people there’s hardly anybody left to listen. With radio and television and telephones we’ve got talking furniture. With bumper stickers we’ve got talking cars. Talking clothes just add to the uproar. If you simply cannot resist being an incompetent klutz, don’t boast about it by wearing a tee shirt that says ‘underachiever and proud of it.’ Being dumb is not the worst thing in the world, but letting your clothes shout it out loud depresses the neighbors and embarrasses your parents. Point three follows from point two, and it’s this: Listen once in a while. It’s amazing what you can hear. On a hot summer day in the country you can hear the corn growing, the crack of a tin roof buckling under the power of the sun. In a real old-fashioned parlor silence so deep you can hear the dust settling on the velveteen settee, you might hear the footsteps of something sinister gaining on you, or a heart-stoppingly beautiful phrase from Mozart you haven’t heard since childhood, or the voice of somebody - now gone - whom you loved. Or sometime when you’re talking up a storm so brilliant, so charming that you can hardly believe how wonderful you are, pause just a moment and listen to yourself. It’s good for the soul to hear yourself as others hear you, and next time maybe, just maybe, you will not talk so much, so loudly, so brilliantly, so charmingly, so utterly shamefully foolishly. Point four: Sleep in the nude. In an age when people don’t even get dressed to go to the theater anymore, it’s silly getting dressed up to go to bed. What’s more, now that you can no longer smoke, drink gin or eat bacon and eggs without somebody trying to make you feel ashamed of yourself, sleeping in the nude is one deliciously sinful pleasure you can commit without being caught by the Puritan police squads that patrol the nation. Point five: Turn off the TV once or twice a month and pick up a book. It will ease your blood pressure. It might even wake up your mind, but if it puts you to sleep you’re still a winner. Better to sleep than have to watch that endless parade of body bags the local news channel marches through your parlor. Six: Don’t take your gun to town. Don’t even leave it home unless you lock all your bullets in a safe deposit box in a faraway bank. The surest way to get shot is not to drop by the nearest convenience store for a bottle of milk at midnight, but to keep a loaded pistol in you own house. What about your constitutional right to bear arms, you say. I would simply point out that you don’t have to exercise a constitutional right just because you have it. You have the constitutional right to run for president of the United States, abut most people have too much sense to insist on exercising it. Seven: Learn to fear the automobile. It is not the trillion-dollar deficit that will finally destroy America. It is the automobile. Congressional studies of future highway needs are terrifying. A typical projection shows that when your generation is middle-aged, Interstate 95 between Miami and Fort Lauderdale will have to be 22 lanes wide to avert total paralysis of south Florida. Imagine an entire country covered with asphalt. My grandfather’s generation shot horses. Yours had better learn to shoot automobiles. Eight: Have some children. Children add texture to your life. They will save you from turning into old fogies before you’re middle-aged. They will teach you humility. When old age overtakes you, as it inevitably will I’m sorry to say, having a few children will provide you with people who will feel guilty when they’re accused of being ungrateful for all you’ve done for them. It’s almost impossible nowadays to find anybody who will feel guilty about anything, including mass murder. When you reach the golden years, your best bet is children, the ingrates. Nine: Get married. I know you don’t want to hear this, but getting married will give you a lot more satisfaction in the long run than your BMW. It provides a standard set of parent for your children and gives you that second income you will need when it’s time to send those children to Connecticut College. What’s more, without marriage you will have practically no material at all to work with when you decide to write a book or hire a psychiatrist. When you get married, whatever you do, do not ask a lawyer to draw up a marriage contract spelling out how your lives will be divvied up when you get divorced. It’s hard enough making a marriage work without having a blueprint for its destruction drawn up before you go to the altar. Speaking of lawyers brings me to point nine and a half, which is: Avoid lawyers unless you have nothing to do with the rest of your life but kill time. And finally, point 10: Smile. You’re one of the luckiest people in the world. You’re living in America. Enjoy it. I feel obliged to give you this banal advice because, although I’ve lived through the Great Depression, World War II, terrible wars in Korea and Vietnam, and half a century of cold war, I have never seen a time when there were so many Americans so angry or so mean-spirited or so sour about the country as there are today. Anger has become the national habit. You see it on the sullen faces of fashion models scowling out of magazines. it pours out of the radio. Washington television hams snarl and shout at each other on television. Ordinary people abuse politicians and their wives with shockingly coarse insults. Rudeness has become an acceptable way of announcing you are sick and tired of it all and are not going to take it anymore. Vile speech is justified on the same ground and is inescapable. America is angry at Washington, angry at the press, angry at immigrants, angry at television, angry at traffic, angry at people who are well off and angry at people who are poor, angry at blacks and angry at whites. The old are angry at the young, the young angry at the old. Suburbs are angry at the cities, cities are angry at the suburbs. Rustic America is angry at both whenever urban and suburban invaders threaten the rustic sense of having escaped from God’s angry land. A complete catalog of the varieties of bile poisoning the American soul would fill a library. The question is: why? Why has anger become the common response to the inevitable ups and down of nation life? The question is baffling not just because the American habit even in the worst of times has traditionally been mindless optimism, but also because there is so little for Americans to be angry about nowadays. We are the planet’s undisputed super power. For the first time in 60 years we enjoy something very much like real peace. We are by all odds the wealthiest nation on earth, though admittedly our vast treasure is not evenly shared. Forgive me the geezer’s sin of talking about “the bad old days,” but the country is still full of people who remember when 35 dollars a week was considered a living wage for a whole family. People whine about being overtaxed, yet in the 1950s the top income-tax rate was 91 percent, universal military service was the law of the land, and racial segregation was legally enforced in large parts of the country. So what explains the fury and dyspepsia? I suspect it’s the famous American ignorance of history. People who know nothing of even the most recent past are easily gulled by slick operators who prosper by exploiting the ignorant. Among these rascals are our politicians. Politicians flourish by sowing discontent. They triumph by churning discontent into anger. Press, television and radio also have a big financial stake in keeping the county boiling mad. Good news, as you know, does not sell papers or keep millions glued to radios and TV screens. So when you get out there in the world, ladies and gentlemen, you’re going to find yourself surrounded by shouting, red-in-the-face, stomping-mad politicians, radio yakmeisters and, yes sad to say, newspaper columnists, telling you ‘you never had it so bad’ and otherwise trying to spoil your day. When they come at you with that , ladies and gentlemen, give them a wink and a smile and a good view of your departing back. And as you stroll away, bend down to smell a flower. Now it seems I have run past the 15-minute limit and will have to buy my own lunch. That’s life Class of 1995. No free lunch. My sermon is done.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"Mr. President, Mr. Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, One evening not long ago I was sitting in an outdoor restaurant by the water. My chair was almost identical to the chairs they have in restaurants by the Vltava River in Prague. They were playing the same rock music they play in most Czech restaurants. I saw advertisements I’m familiar with back home. Above all, I was surrounded by young people who were similarly dressed, who drank familiar-looking drinks, and who behaved as casually as their contemporaries in Prague. Only their complexion and their facial features were different - for I was in Singapore. I sat there thinking about this and again - for the umpteenth time - I realized an almost banal truth: that we now live in a single global civilization. The identity of this civilization does not lie merely in similar forms of dress, or similar drinks, or in the constant buzz of the same commercial music all around the world, or even in international advertising. It lies in something deeper: thanks to the modern idea of constant progress, with its inherent expansionism, and to the rapid evolution of science that comes directly from it, our planet has, for the first time in the long history of the human race, been covered in the space of a very few decades by a single civilization - one that is essentially technological. The world is now enmeshed in webs of telecommunication networks consisting of millions of tiny threads, or capillaries, that not only transmit information of all kinds at lightning speed, but also convey integrated models of social, political and economic behavior. They are conduits for legal norms, as well as for billions and billions of dollars crisscrossing the world while remaining invisible even to those who deal directly with them. The life of the human race is completely interconnected not only in the informational sense, but in the causal sense as well. Anecdotally, I could illustrate this by reminding you - since I’ve already mentioned Singapore - that today all it takes is a single shady transaction initiated by a single devious bank clerk in Singapore to bring down a bank on the other side of the world. Thanks to the accomplishments of this civilization, practically all of us know what checks, bonds, bills of exchange, and stocks are. We are familiar with CNN and Chernobyl, and we know who the Rolling Stones, or Nelson Mandela, or Salman Rushdie are. More than that, the capillaries that have so radically integrated this civilization also convey information about certain modes of human co-existence that have proven their worth, like democracy, respect for human rights, the rule of law, the laws of the market-place. Such information flows around the world and, in varying degrees, takes root in different places. In modern times this global civilization emerged in the territory occupied by European and ultimately by Euro-American culture. Historically, it evolved from a combination of traditions - classical, Judaic and Christian. And yet there is something not quite right about it. Allow me to use this ceremonial gathering for a brief meditation on a subject which I have dwelt upon a great deal, and which I often bring up on occasions resembling this one. I want to focus today on the source of the dangers that threaten humanity in spite of this global civilization, and often directly because of it. Above all, I would like to speak about the ways in which these dangers can be confronted. Many of the great problems we face today, as far as I understand them, have their origin in the fact that this global civilization, though in evidence everywhere, is no more than a thin veneer over the sum total of human awareness, if I may put it that way. This civilization is immensely fresh, young, new, and fragile, and the human spirit has accepted it with dizzying alacrity, without itself changing in any essential way. Humanity has gradually, and in very diverse ways, shaped our habits of mind, our relationship to the world, our models of behavior and the values we accept and recognize. In essence, this new, single epidermis of world civilization merely covers or conceals the immense variety of cultures, of peoples, of religious worlds, of historical traditions and historically formed attitudes, all of which in a sense lie “beneath” it. At the same time, even as the veneer of world civilization expands, this “underside” of humanity, this hidden dimension of it, demands more and more clearly to be heard and to be granted a right to life. And thus, while the world as a whole increasingly accepts the new habits of global civilization, another contradictory process is taking place: ancient traditions are reviving, different religions and cultures are awakening to new ways of being, seeking new room to exist, and struggling with growing fervor to realize what is unique to them and what makes them different from others. Ultimately they seek to give their individuality a political expression. It is often said that in our time, every valley cries out for its own independence or will even fight for it. Many nations, or parts of them at least, are struggling against modern civilization or its main proponents for the right to worship their ancient gods and obey the ancient divine injunctions. They carry on their struggle using weapons provided by the very civilization they oppose. They employ radar, computers, lasers, nerve gases, and perhaps, in the future, even nuclear weapons - all products of the world of modern civilization. In contrast with these technological inventions, other products of this civilization - like democracy or the idea of human rights - are not accepted in many places in the world because they are deemed to be hostile to local traditions. In other words: the Euro-American world has equipped other parts of the globe with instruments that not only could effectively destroy the enlightened values which, among other things, made possible the invention of precisely these instruments, but which could well cripple the capacity of people to live together on this earth. What follows from all of this? It is my belief that this state of affairs contains a clear challenge not only to the Euro-American world but to our present-day civilization as a whole. It is a challenge to this civilization to start understanding itself as a multi-cultural and a multi-polar civilization, whose meaning lies not in undermining the individuality of different spheres of culture and civilization but in allowing them to be more completely themselves. This will only be possible, even conceivable, if we all accept a basic code of mutual co-existence, a kind of common minimum we can all share, one that will enable us to go on living side by side. Yet such a code won’t stand a chance if it is merely the product of a few who then proceed to force it on the rest. It must be an expression of the authentic will of everyone, growing out of the genuine spiritual roots hidden beneath the skin of our common, global civilization. If it is merely disseminated through the capillaries of the skin, the way Coca-cola ads are - as a commodity offered by some to others - such a code can hardly be expected to take hold in any profound or universal way. But is humanity capable of such an undertaking? Is it not a hopelessly utopian idea? Haven’t we so lost control of our destiny that we are condemned to gradual extinction in ever harsher high-tech clashes between cultures, because of our fatal inability to cooperate-operate in the face of impending catastrophes, be they ecological, social, or demographic, or of dangers generated by the state of our civilization as such? I don’t know. But I have not lost hope. I have not lost hope because I am persuaded again and again that, lying dormant in the deepest roots of most, if not all, cultures there is an essential similarity, something that could be made - if the will to do so existed - a genuinely unifying starting point for that new code of human co-existence that would be firmly anchored in the great diversity of human traditions. Don’t we find somewhere in the foundations of most religions and cultures, though they may take a thousand and one distinct forms, common elements such as respect for what transcends us, whether we mean the mystery of being, or a moral order that stands above us; respect for our neighbors, for our families, for certain natural authorities; respect for human dignity and for nature: a sense of solidarity and benevolence towards guests who come with good intentions? Isn’t the common, ancient origin or human roots of our diverse spiritualities, each of which is merely another kind of human understanding of the same reality, the thing that can genuinely bring people of different cultures together? And aren’t the basic commandments of this archetypal spirituality in harmony with what even an unreligious person - without knowing exactly why - may consider proper and meaningful? Naturally, I am not suggesting that modern people be compelled to worship ancient deities and accept rituals they have long since abandoned. I am suggesting something quite different: we must come to understand the deep mutual connection or kinship between the various forms of our spirituality. We must recollect our original spiritual and moral substance, which grew out of the same essential experience of humanity. I believe that this is the only way to achieve a genuine renewal of our sense of responsibility for ourselves and for the world. And at the same time, it is the only way to achieve a deeper understanding among cultures that will enable them to work together in a truly ecumenical way to create a new order for the world. The veneer of global civilization that envelops the modern world and the consciousness of humanity, as we all know, has a dual nature, bringing into question, at every step of the way, the very values it is based upon, or which it propagates. The thousands of marvelous achievements of this civilization that work for us so well and enrich us can equally impoverish, diminish, and destroy our lives, and frequently do. Instead of serving people, many of these creations enslave them. Instead of helping people to develop their identities, they take them away. Almost every invention or discovery - from the splitting of the atom and the discovery of DNA to television and the computer - can be turned against us and used to our detriment. How much easier it is today than it was during the First World War to destroy an entire metropolis in a single air-raid. And how much easier would it be today, in the era of television, for a madman like Hitler or Stalin to pervert the spirit of a whole nation. When have people ever had the power we now possess to alter the climate of the planet or deplete its mineral resources or the wealth of its fauna and flora in the space of a few short decades? And how much more destructive potential do terrorists have at their disposal today than at the beginning of this century. In our era, it would seem that one part of the human brain, the rational part which has made all these morally neutral discoveries, has undergone exceptional development, while the other part, which should be alert to ensure that these discoveries really serve humanity and will not destroy it, has lagged behind catastrophically. Yes, regardless of where I begin my thinking about the problems facing our civilization, I always return to the theme of human responsibility, which seems incapable of keeping pace with civilization and preventing it from turning against the human race. It’s as though the world has simply become too much for us to deal with. There is no way back. Only a dreamer can believe that the solution lies in curtailing the progress of civilization in some way or other. The main task in the coming era is something else: a radical renewal of our sense of responsibility. Our conscience must catch up to our reason, otherwise we are lost. It is my profound belief that there is only one way to achieve this: we must divest ourselves of our egotistical anthroponcentrism, our habit of seeing ourselves as masters of the universe who can do whatever occurs to us. We must discover a new respect for what transcends us: for the universe, for the earth, for nature, for life, and for reality. Our respect for other people, for other nations and for other cultures, can only grow from a humble respect for the cosmic order and from an awareness that we are a part of it, that we share in it and that nothing of what we do is lost, but rather becomes part of the eternal memory of being, where it is judged. A better alternative of the future of humanity, therefore, clearly lies in imbuing our civilization with a spiritual dimension. It’s not just a matter of understanding its multi-cultural nature and finding inspiration for the creation of a new world order in the common roots of all cultures. It is also essential that the Euro-American cultural sphere - the one which created this civilization and taught humanity its destructive pride - now return to its own spiritual roots and become an example to the rest of the world in the search for a new humility. General observations of this type are certainly not difficult to make nor are they new or revolutionary. Modern people are masters at describing the crisis and the misery of the world which we shape, and for which we are responsible. We are much less adept at putting things right. So what specifically is to be done? I do not believe in some universal key or panacea. I am not an advocate of what Karl Popper called “holistic social engineering”, particularly because I had to live most of my adult life in circumstances that resulted from an attempt to create a holistic Marxist utopia. I know more than enough, therefore, about efforts of this kind. This does not relieve me, however, of the responsibility to think of ways to make the world better. It will certainly not be easy to awaken in people a new sense of responsibility for the world, an ability to conduct themselves as if they were to live on this earth forever, and to be held answerable for its condition one day. Who knows how many horrific cataclysms humanity may have to go through before such a sense of responsibility is generally accepted. But this does not mean that those who wish to work for it cannot begin at once. It is a great task for teachers, educators, intellectuals, the clergy, artists, entrepreneurs, journalists, people active in all forms of public life. Above all it is a task for politicians. Even in the most democratic of conditions, politicians have immense influence, perhaps more than they themselves realize. This influence does not lie in their actual mandates, which in any case are considerably limited. It lies in something else: in the spontaneous impact their charisma has on the public. The main task of the present generation of politicians is not, I think to ingratiate themselves with the public through the decisions they take or their smiles on television. It is not to go on winning elections and ensuring themselves a place in the sun till the end of their days. Their role is something quite different: to assume their share of responsibility for the long-range prospects of our world and thus to set an example for the public in whose sight they work. Their responsibility is to think ahead boldly, not to fear the disfavor of the crowd, to imbue their actions with a spiritual dimension (which of course is not the same thing as ostentatious attendance at religious services), to explain again and again - both to the public and to their colleagues - that politics must do far more than reflect the interests of particular groups or lobbies. After all, politics is a matter of servicing the community, which means that it is morality in practice, And how better to serve the community and practice morality than by seeking in the midst of the global (and globally threatened) civilization their own global political responsibility: that is, their responsibility for the very survival of the human race? I don’t believe that a politician who sets out on this risky path will inevitably jeopardize his or her political survival. This is a wrongheaded notion which assumes that the citizen is a fool and that political success depends on playing to this folly. That is not the way it is. A conscience slumbers in every human being, something divine. And that is what we have to put our trust in. Ladies and gentlemen, I find myself at perhaps the most famous university in the most powerful country in the world. With your permission, I will say a few words on the subject of the politics of a great power. It is obvious that those who have the greatest power and influence also bear the greatest responsibility. Like it or not, the United States of America now bears probably the greatest responsibility for the direction our world will take. The United States, therefore, should reflect most deeply on this responsibility. Isolationism has never paid off for the United States. Had it entered the First World War earlier, perhaps it would not have had to pay with anything like the casualties it actually incurred. The same is true of the Second World War: when Hitler was getting ready to invade Czechoslovakia, and in so doing finally exposing the lack of courage on the part of the western democracies, your president wrote a letter to the Czechoslovak President imploring him to come to some agreement with Hitler. Had he not deceived himself and the whole world into believing that an agreement could be made with this madman, had he instead shown a few teeth, perhaps the Second World War need not have happened, and tens of thousands of young Americans need not have died fighting in it. Likewise, just before the end of that war, had your President, who was otherwise an outstanding man, said a clear “no” to Stalin’s decision to divide the world, perhaps the Cold War, which cost the United States hundreds of billions of dollars, need not have happened either. I beg you: do not repeat these mistakes! You yourselves have always paid a heavy price for them! There is simply no escaping the responsibility you have as the most powerful country in the world. There is far more at stake here than simply standing up to those who would like once again to divide the world into spheres of interest, or subjugate others who are different from them, and weaker. What is now at stake is saving the human race. In other words, it’s a question of what I’ve already talked about: of understanding modern civilization as a multi-cultural and multi-polar civilization, of turning our attention to the original spiritual sources of human culture and above all, of our own culture, of drawing from these sources the strength for a courageous and magnanimous creation of a new order for the world. Not long ago I was at a gala dinner to mark an important anniversary. There were fifty Heads of State present, perhaps more, who came to honor the heroes and victims of the greatest war in human history. This was not a political conference, but the kind of social event that is meant principally to show hospitality and respect to the invited guests. When the seating plan was given out, I discovered to my surprise that those sitting at the table next to mine were not identified simply as representatives of a particular state, as was the case with all the other tables; they were referred to as “permanent members of the UN Security Council and the G7.” I had mixed feeling about this. On the one hand, I thought how marvelous that the richest and most powerful of this world see each other often and even at this dinner, can talk informally and get to know each other better. On the other hand, a slight chill went down my spine, for I could not help observing that one table had been singled out as being special and particularly important. It was a table for the big powers. Somewhat perversely, I began to imagine that the people sitting at it were, along with their Russian caviar, dividing the rest of us up among themselves, without asking our opinion. Perhaps all this is merely the whimsy of a former and perhaps future playwright. But I wanted to express it here. For one simple reason: to emphasize the terrible gap that exists between the responsibility of the great powers and their hubris. The architect of that seating arrangement - I should think it was none of the attending Presidents - was not guided by a sense of responsibility for the world, but by the banal pride of the powerful. But pride is precisely what will lead the world to hell. I am suggesting an alternative: humbly accepting our responsibility for the world. There is one great opportunity in the matter of co-existence between nations and spheres of civilization, culture and religion that should be grasped and exploited to the limit. This is the appearance of supranational or regional communities. By now, there are many such communities in the world, with diverse characteristics and differing degrees of integration. I believe in this approach. I believe in the importance of organisms that lie somewhere between nation states and a world community, organisms that can be an important medium of global communication and cooperation-operation. I believe that this trend towards integration in a world where - as I’ve said - every valley longs for independence, must be given the greatest possible support. These organisms, however, must not be an expression of integration merely for the sake of integration. They must be one of the many instruments enabling each region, each nation, to be both itself and capable of cooperation-operation with others. That is, they must be one of the instruments enabling countries and peoples who are close to each other geographically, ethnically, culturally and economically and who have common security interest, to form associations and better communicate with each other and with the rest of the world. At the same time, all such regional communities must rid themselves of fear that other like communities are directed against them. Regional groupings in areas that have common tradition and a common political culture ought to be a natural part of the complex political architecture of the world. Co-operation between such regions ought to be a natural component of cooperation-operation on a world-wide scale. As long as the broadening of NATO membership to include countries who feel culturally and politically a part of the region the Alliance was created to defend is seen by Russia, for example, as an anti-Russian undertaking, it will be a sign that Russia has not yet understood the challenge of this era. The most important world organization is the United Nations. I think that the fiftieth anniversary of its birth could be an occasion to reflect on how to infuse it with a new ethos, a new strength, and a new meaning, and make it the truly most important arena of good cooperation-operation among all cultures that make up our planetary civilization. But neither the strengthening of regional structures nor the strengthening of the UN will save the world if both processes are not informed by that renewed spiritual charge which I see as the only hope that the human race will survive another millennium. I have touched on what I think politicians should do. There is, however, one more force that has at least as much, if not more, influence on the general state of mind as politicians do. That force is the mass media. Only when fate sent me into the realm of high politics did I become fully aware of the media’s double-edged power. Their dual impact is not a specialty of the media. It is merely a part, or an expression of the dual nature of today’s civilization of which I have already spoken. Thanks to television the whole world discovered, in the course of an evening, that there is a country called Rwanda where people are suffering beyond belief. Thanks to television it is possible to do at least a little to help those who are suffering. Thanks to television the whole world, in the course of a few seconds, was shocked and horrified about what happened in Oklahoma City and, at the same time, understood it as a great warning for all. Thanks to television the whole world knows that there exists an internationally recognized country called Bosnia and Herzegovina and that from the moment it recognized this country, the international community has tried unsuccessfully to divide it into grotesque mini-states according to the wishes of warlords who have never been recognized by anyone as anyone’s legitimate representatives. That is the wonderful side of today’s mass media, or rather, of those who gather the news. Humanity’s thanks belong to all those courageous reporters who voluntarily risk their lives wherever something evil is happening, in order to arouse the conscience of the world. There is, however, another, less wonderful, aspect of television, one that merely revels in the horrors of the world or, unforgivably, makes them commonplace, or compels politicians to become first of all television stars. But where is it written that someone who is good on television is necessarily also a good politician? I never fail to be astonished at how much I am at the mercy of television directors and editors, at how my public image depends far more on them than it does on myself, at how important it is to smile appropriately on television, or choose the right tie; at how television forces me to express my thoughts as sparely as possible, in witticisms, slogans or sound bites; at how easily my television image can be made to seem different from the real me. I am astonished by this and at the same time, I fear it serves no good purpose. I know politicians who have learned to see themselves only as the television camera does. Television has thus expropriated their personalities, and made them into something like television shadows of their former selves. I sometimes wonder whether they even sleep in a way that will look good on television. I am not outraged with television or the press for distorting what I say or ignoring it, or editing me to appear like some strange monster. I am not angry with the media when I see that a politician’s rise or fall often depends more on them than on the politician concerned. What interests me is something else: the responsibility of those who have the mass media in their hands. They too bear responsibility for the world, and for the future of humanity. Just as the splitting of the atom can immensely enrich humanity in a thousand and one ways and, at the same time, can also threaten it with destruction, so television can have both good and evil consequences. Quickly, suggestively and to an unprecedented degree, it can disseminate the spirit of understanding, humanity, human solidarity and spirituality, or it can stupefy whole nations and continents. And just as our use of atomic energy depends solely on our sense of responsibility, so the proper use of television’s power to enter practically every house hold and every human mind depends on our sense of responsibility as well. Whether our world is to be saved from everything that threatens it today depends above all on whether human beings come to their senses, whether they understand the degree of their responsibility and discover a new relationship to the very miracle of being. The world is in the hands of us all. And yet some have a greater influence on its fate than others. The more influence a person has - be they politician or television announcer - the greater the demands placed on their sense of responsibility and the less they should think merely about personal interests. In conclusion, allow me a brief personal remark. I was born in Prague and I lived there for decades without being allowed to study properly or visit other countries. Nevertheless, my mother never abandoned one of her secret and quite extravagant dreams: that one day I would study at Harvard. Fate did not permit me to fulfill her dream. But something else happened, something that would never have occurred even to my mother: I have received a doctoral degree at Harvard without even having to study here. More than that, I have been given to see Singapore, and countless other exotic places. I have been given to understand how small this world is and how it torments itself with countless things it need not torment itself with if people could find within themselves a little more courage, a little more hope, a little more responsibility, a little more mutual understanding and love. I don’t know whether my mother is looking down at me from heaven, but if she is I can guess what she’s probably thinking; she’s thinking that I’m sticking my nose into matters that only people who have properly studied political science at Harvard have the right to stick their noses into. I hope that you don’t think so. Thank you for your attention.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"Thank you so very much, Professor William Chace. I would first like to extend my congratulations to the Class of 1993 at Wesleyan University. Wesleyan University is a very special place. I recall my years at Yale: I would drive down once a week to go to the Malcolm X House as we reflected on the complexities of race and class and gender and sexual orientation, convinced that we were going to make this country and world a better place. But the Class of 1993 is a special class in a special place. I know your history. You’ve been through some struggles, and it’s getting you ready for what the world has to offer. ‘Cause even in this grand moment of celebration and jubilation, we’re living in one of the most terrifying and frightening moments in the history of this country - unprecedented lethal linkage of economic decline and cultural decay and political malaise. Yes, the downward mobility and the poverty and fear of poverty. Yes, the cultural consumption that promotes an addiction to stimulation that tries to convince us that we are vital and vibrant only when we’re consuming. Down and out? Go to the mall. Feeling down and out? Turn on the television and reinforce that spectatorial passivity. Yes, that’s so much of what this culture is about. And the political malaise - even given Brother Clinton in the White House and Sister Hillary - thank god for her - this deep sense that maybe public institutions no longer have the wherewithal to respond to the deep problems. Yes, that’s our moment. But I say to the Class of 1993 that you can make a fundamental difference. Not alone, but playing a very crucial role. And you can do it in the following way: You can try to revitalize public life; and by public life all I mean is acknowledging our interdependencies and interrelationships upon one another. I’m not talking about simply identities, I’m not talking simply about constituencies. I’m talking about that rich notion of citizenship, the idea that ordinary people are capable of ruling or being ruled. And hence, putting a premium on the alternation of rule and the rotation of rulers. It’s a precious ideal. It’s called democracy. And how rare democracies are in human history, and usually short-lived. And when they’re undermined, it usually has much to do with the levels of poverty that produce a despair and desperation, or levels of paranoia that produce levels of distrust and suspicion. But my advice, my humble advice, to the Class of 1993 is to expand public conversation in this democracy by first having a deep and abiding sense of history. And how un-American that is, to cut against the grain. Henry Ford, in many ways an exemplary American - not simply a genius of invention and innovation creating that automobile that exemplifies mobility and individuality, but also the same Henry ford with the ugly anti-Semitic sensibilities from Detroit - but Henry Ford said, History is bunk. He spoke for so many Americans: History is bunk. Ralph Waldo Emerson said, Everything good is on the highway. It’s Huck on the boat. It’s Ahab on the ship. It’s Kerouac on the road. It’s Louis Armstrong on and off the beat. It’s Sarah Vaughn in the blues. It’s James Brown on the good foot. But, I say to you, one must have a tragic sense of history. Hegel said, History is a slaughterhouse because of the blood, sweat and tears. Gibbon said, It’s a series of human crimes and follies and misfortunes. And we know, yes, history is inextricably interwoven with scars and bruises and wounds and hurts and heartache and sorrow and grief, but it’s more than that. We ought not to confuse the tragic with the pathetic. The tragic is about the exploration of human possibilities for freedom. That’s what Sophocles’ Antigone is about. That’s what Shakespeare’s King Lear is about. That’s what Toni Morrison’s Beloved is about: the exploration of the human possibilities of freedom, but hitting up against limits sooner or later. A tragic sense of history will give you a view of the world in which no culture and no civilization and no society has a monopoly on wisdom or virtue. It would allow you to see ambiguous legacies in the past, to accent hybrid cultures, because every culture that we know is based in part on fragments of antecedent cultures. No pure and pristine traditions here. No Manichaean visions. No either/or perspectives here. It’s about complexity and subtlety. And going hand in hand with that tragic sense of history is an all-embracing moral vision, because a tragic sense of history should generate a sense of empathy and sympathy, of trying to identify with the frustrations and anxieties of others, of those who look other and come from other places and have other sexual orientations. All-embracing moral vision - never losing sight of the humanity of others. Simone Weil, the great French Jewish philosopher, said it well when she said, “Love of thy neighbor and all of its fullness - being able to say to him or her, ‘What are you going through? Can I be of service?’” And, yes it’s true that an all-embracing moral vision means that we have to cut against the grain because we live in a moment of xenophobic frenzy, of groups and tribes and clans and nations that want to close ranks, put up thick walls of demarcation, make it more difficult to build the kind of bridges that we know are requisite to create not simply a sustainable, but a just society and world. And hand in hand with an all-embracing moral vision is in many ways the most difficult, self-critical courageous stands. And Friedrick Nietzsche said it well when he said, “It’s not simply a question of having the courage of one’s convictions, but at times having the courage to attack one’s convictions.” That’s how you grow. That how you mature. That’s how you develop. Look at Malcolm X himself, what a great example of a man who was willing to grow because he realized that he had to attack, at times, his own convictions. Socrates said it well when he said, “the unexamined life is not worth living.” but we need to add that the examined life is painful, risky, full of vulnerability. And, yet, to revitalize public conversation, we have to ensure that self-criticism and self-correction are accented both in our individual lives, as well as in our society and world. Last, but not least, there is a need for audacious hope. And it’s not optimism. I’m in no way an optimist. I’ve been black in America for 39 years. No ground for optimism here, given the progress and regress and three steps forward and four steps backward. Optimism is a notion that there’s sufficient evidence that would allow us to infer that if we keep doing what we’re doing, things will get better. I don’t believe that. I’m a prisoner of hope, that’s something else. Cutting against the grain, against the evidence. William James said it so well in that grand and masterful essay of his of 1879 called “The Sentiment of Rationality,” where he talked about faith being the courage to act when doubt is warranted. And that’s what I’m talking about. Of course I come from a tradition, a black church tradition, in which we defined faith as stepping out on nothing and landing on something. That’s the history of black folk in this country. Hope against hope. And yet still trying to sustain the notion that we world-weary and tired peoples, all peoples in this society, can be energized and galvanized around causes and principles and ideals that are bigger than us, that can appeal to the better angels of our nature, so that we, in fact, can reach the conclusion that the world in incomplete - that history in unfinished, that the future is open-ended, that what we think and what we do does make a difference. So, to the Class of 1993, I say with you, as Earth, Wind and Fire put it so well a few decades ago, “Keep you head to the sky,” or as the civil rights movement said so clearly, “Keep you eyes on the prize,” not on each other, but on the prize. And as Mahalia Jackson used to sing so powerfully, Keep your hand on the plow. God bless you, good luck, and let’s try to make this world a better place by example and by struggle. Thank you so very much.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"The sportswriter Red Smith was one of my heroes. Not long before his own death he gave the eulogy at the funeral of another writer, and he said, “dying is no big deal. Living is the trick.” Living is the trick. That’s what we’re all given one chance to do well. One reason I admire Red Smith was that he wrote about sports for 55 years, with elegance and humor, without ever succumbing to the pressure, which ruined many sportswriters, that he ought to be writing about something “serious.” Red Smith found in sportswriting exactly what he wanted to do and what he deeply loved doing. And because it was right for him he said more important things about American values than many writers who wrote about serious subjects–so seriously that nobody could read them. Another story. When I was teaching at Yale, the poet Allen Ginsberg came to talk to my students, and one of them asked him: “was there a point at which you consciously decided to become a poet?” And Ginsberg said: ‘It’s wasn’t quite a choice; it was a realization. I was 28 and I had a job as a market researcher. One day I told my psychiatrist that what I really wanted to do was to quit my job and just write poetry. And the psychiatrist said, “why not?” And I said, “Well, what would the American Psychoanalytic Association say?” And he said, “There’s no party line.” So I did. We’ll never know how bit a loss that was for the field of market research. But it was a big moment for American poetry. There’s no party line. Good advice. You can be your own party line. If living is the trick, what’s crucial for you is to do something that makes the best use of your own gifts and your own individuality. There’s only one you. Don’t ever let anyone persuade you that you’re somebody else. My father was a businessman. His name was William Zinsser, and he had a business called William Zinsser & Company that had been founded by his grandfather, also named William Zinsser, who came to New York from Germany in 1849 with a formula for making shellac. He built a little house and a little factory way uptown at what is now 59th Street and Eleventh Avenue. I have an old photograph of those two buildings, all alone in an open field full of rocks that slopes down to the Hudson River. That business stayed there until 15 years ago–a 125 years. It’s very rare for a business to stay in the same family on the same block in mid-Manhattan for a century, and I can assure you that it builds a sense of family continuity. One of the most vivid memories of my boyhood is how much my father loved his business. He had a passion for quality; he hated anything second-rate. Seeing how much he loved his work and how good he was at it, I learned very early what has been a guiding principle of my life: that what we want to do we will do well. The opposite, however, is also true: what we don’t want to do we won’t do well–and I had a different dream. I wanted to be a newspaperman. Unfortunately, my father had three daughters before he had me. I was his only son. He named me William Zinsser and looked forward to the day when I’d join him in the business. (In those Dark Ages the idea that daughters could run a company just as well as sons, or better, was still 20 years off). It was a ready-made career for me–lifelong security–and maybe I also owed it to my mother and my sisters to carry on that hundred-year-old family tradition. But when the time came to choose, I knew that that just wasn’t the right thing for me to do, and I went looking for a newspaper job, and got one with the New York Herald Tribune, and I loved it from the start. Of course, that was a moment of great pain for my father–and also for me. But my father never tried to change my mind. He saw that I was happy, and he wished me well in my chosen work. That was by far the best gift I ever received, beyond price or value–partly, of course, because it was an outright gift of love and confidence, but mainly because it freed me from having to fulfill somebody else’s expectations, which were not the right ones for me. The Herald Tribune at that time was the best written and best edited newspaper in America. The older editors on that paper were the people who gave me the values that I’ve tried to apply to my work ever since, whatever that work has been. They were custodians of the best. When they made us rewrite what we had written and rewritten, it wasn’t only for our own good; it was for the honorableness of the craft. But the paper began to lose money, and the owners gradually cheapened their standards in an effort to get new readers (which they therefore couldn’t get), and suddenly it was no longer a paper that was fun to work for, because it was no longer the paper I had loved. So on that day I just quit. By then I was married and had a one-year-old daughter, and when I came home and told my wife that I had quit she said, “what are you going to do now?” which I thought was a fair question. And I said, “I guess I’m a freelance writer.” And that’s what I was, for the next eleven years. It’s a life full of risk: the checks don’t arrive as often as the bills, or with any regularity. But those 11 years were the broadest kind of education; no other job could have exposed me to so many areas of knowledge. Also: In those eleven years I never wrote anything that I didnt’ want to write. I’d like you to remember that. You don’t have to do unfulfilling work, or work that diminishes you. You don’t have to work for people you don’t respect. You’re bright enough to figure out how to do work that you do want to do, and how to work for people you do want to work for. Near the end of the ’60s my wife said she thought it might be interesting to live somewhere besides New York and see what that was like. Well, to suggest to a fourth-generation New Yorker that there’s life outside New York is heresy. But I began to discuss the idea with friends, and one of them said, “you know, change is a tonic.” I didn’t know that. I was afraid of change; I think most people are. But I seized on the phrase “change is a tonic” and it gave me the energy to go ahead. I had always wanted to teach writing: to try to give back some of the things I had learned. So I started sending letters to colleges all over the country–big colleges, small colleges, colleges nobody had ever heard of, experimental colleges tha I actually went and visited; one was in a redwood forest in California and one seemed to be in a swamp in Florida–asking if they had some kind of place for me. And they didn’t, because I was not an academic–I only had a BA degree, like the one you’ll have in about five minutes–and it was very discouraging. But finally one thing led to another. It always does. If you talk to enough people about your hopes and your dreams, if you poke down enough roads and keep believing in yourself, sooner or later a circle will connect. You make your own luck. Well, one thing led to another, and one day I got a call from a professor at Yale who said he would take a chance and let me teach an experimental writing course for one term (by the way, that was almost two years after I had started sending all those letters). And on that slender thread we sold our apartment in New York and moved to New Haven, a city we had never seen before, and started a new life. Yale was totally generous to me, though I was a layman from out of nowhere–a journalist, god forbid. I was allowed to initiate a nonfiction writing course, which the Yale English department later adopted, and I was also allowed to be master of one of Yale’s residential colleges. So those were rich years for me–years of both teaching and learning–because they were unlike anything I had done before. Now the fact that Yale let me do all this is the reason I’m telling you the story. I didn’t fit any academic pattern. But finally, being different was not a handicap. Never be afraid to be different. Don’t assume that people you’d like to work for have defined their needs as narrowly as you think they have–that they know exactly who they want. What any good executive is looking for is general intelligence, breadth, originality, imagination, audacity, a sense of history, a sense of cultural context, a sense of wonder, a sense of humor, far more than he or she is looking for a precise fit. America has more than enough college graduates every year who are willing to go through life being someone else’s precise fit. What we need are men and women who will dare to break the mold of tired thinking–who just won’t buy somebody saying, “we’ve always done it this way. This way is good enough.” Well, obviously it’s not good enough or the country wouldn’t be in the mess it’s in. I don’t have to tell you all the areas where this wonderful country is not living up to its best dreams: Poverty. Inequality. Injustice. Debt. Illiteracy. Health care. Day care. Homelessness. Pollution. Arms-spending that milks us of the money that should be going into life-affirming work. There’s no corner of American life that doesn’t need radically fresh thinking. Don’t shape yourself to a dumb job; shape the job to your strengths and your curiosity and your ideals. I’ve told you this story of my life for whatever pieces of it you may have wanted to grab as it went by… If I had to sum up why my work has been interesting it’s because I changed the direction of my life every eight or nine years and never did–or continued to do–what was expected. I didn’t go into the family business; I didn’t stay at the Herald Tribune; I didn’t stay in New York. And I didn’t stay at Yale. In 1979 I made a resume, like every Yale senior (they showed me how to do it–how to make it look nice), and went job-hunting in New York, and got a job with the Book-of-the-Month Club, which was still another new field for me, and in many ways those eight years were the most interesting years of all. So don’t become a prisoner of any plans and dreams except your own best plans and dreams. Don’t assume that if you don’t do what some people seem to be insisting that you do, in this goal-obsessed and money-obsessed and security-obsessed nation, it’s the end of the world. It’s not the end of the world. As my experience with my father proves, something very nourishing can happen–a blessing, a form of grace. Be ready to be surprised by grace. And be very wary of security as a goal. It may often look like life’s best prize. Usually it’s not….For you, I hope today will be the first of many separations that will mean the putting behind you of something you’ve done well and the beginning of something you’ll do just as well, or better. Keep separating yourself from any project that’s not up to your highest standards of what’s right for you–and for the broader community where you can affect the quality of life: your home, your town, your children’s schools, your state, your country, your world. If living is the trick, live usefully; nothing in your life will be as satisfying as making a difference in somebody else’s life. Separate yourself from cynics and from peddlers of despair. Don’t let anyone tell you it won’t work. Men and women, women and men, of the Wesleyan Class of 1988: There’s no party line. You make your own luck. Change is a tonic. One thing leads to another. Living is the trick. Thank you.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"President Oakley, trustees, faculty, friends and most especially members of the graduating class. One always says it, but this time it is true: I am honored to be here. Williams is one of the few truly great colleges in this country, known consistently over the years for both its academic excellence and its civility. To those of us who were once young and spent some time here, it is, of course, also known for other things. These I will not dwell on except to say that from my years as an undergraduate at Smith, I still retain many happy memories of utterly dissolute weekends at Williams. In my wildest imaginings at the time I could not have supposed that one day, doddering and infirm, I would be standing up here with the forces of law and order. I want to talk to you today about journalism, not just because it is pretty much the only thing I know, but also because what journalists try to do is really little more than what everyone tries to do, one way and another, in daily life. The first thing to be said about that process, of course, at least as it is carried out by working journalists, is that nobody, or practically nobody, is ever pleased with the result. Nobody ever has been. There have been trouble making pundits in our midst, after all, since the days of the Hebrew prophets and Greek seers, folks who really know how to rain on a politician’s parade. Agamemnon spoke for more than himself I think and more than he knew - including perhaps a whole succession of American presidents - when he said to the seer Kalkhas, the first syndicated columnist, as I see it: “You visionary of hell, never have I had fair play in your forecasts. Calamity is all you care about, or see, no happy portents, and you bring to pass nothing agreeable.” Or, as it is regularly put these days: Why don’t you people ever report the good news? But, importantly, it is not just politicians and other objects of journalistic attention who are inclined to resist discomfiting news. It is just as often the general public too, and again, always has been. No one in history summed up the sentiment more concisely than the 19th century bishop’s wife, whose words, upon learning of Charles Darwin’s thesis that all humankind was descended from apes, speak to the ages: “Let us hope it is not true, and if it is, let us pray it does not become generally known.” Let me quickly say that I am not endorsing here the idea, beloved of some in our business, that the very resentment we stir must be proof of both our accuracy and our virtue. On the contrary, it demonstrates neither. The amount of hostility and discomfort we generate, is no more reliable an index of the quality of our reporting and analysis than is the presence of the sunnier, chirpier view of things, the view so devoutly preferred by Agamemnon, the bishop’s wife and whatever rogue politician or preacher we may be scrutinizing that day. It is lazy, defective journalism and, by extension, lazy defective thinking on the reader’s part, to assume otherwise. Saying things are terrible does not automatically establish the reliability of your account. You need to understand this not just if your are going to be a good professional journalist, but equally if you are going to be an intelligent lay journalist in life; you need to understand it if you are going to be able to read your newspaper critically or react reasonably to the Babel of high-powered analysis that comes your way so relentlessly these days. Consider the moment - June of 1987. It is, according to the fashionable consensus, the most immoral of times. And included in the impressionistic evidence that this is so, I am sorry to say, is a recurrent, blanket condemnation of the class of ‘87, culminating in the preposterous assertion that there is just no intellectual energy or even public service heartbeat to be found in your generation, nothing but a lust for possessions. Obviously there are some who fit the description. But anyone who knows more than a handful of people of your age, and anyone, I may add, who has read into the literature of Williams College as I have recently done and followed the tremendous individual volunteer efforts going on, will know that this is not true. Yet somehow, despite the evidence, the crazy all-devouring generalization lives on. How can you yourself protect against interpreting the world around you in a similarly fatuous way? Precisely by avoiding the pitfalls of bad journalism and bad general analysis that lead to it. I will identify just a couple of these. They are habits of mind which have not only helped to create the present overwrought sense of universal moral collapse, but also, ironically, worked to keep us from seeing what may be truly distinctive and repugnant in the age. Two stand out. First, if, God willing, you have studied some history while you were here, you will have helped guard against the most empty-headed of these: the disposition to suppose that everything is happening for the first time – that every human foible and ethical lapse you see is not just the first, but also the worst. This is uneducated and ahistorical. In the great preacher wars and revelations now going on, for instance, some of us may be meeting Jim and Tammy Baker for the first time. But history isn’t. They and many of the other principals in the drama are well known. Will Rogers and H. L. Mencken knew them. So did Mark Twain. So did Edward Gibbon and Geoffrey Chaucer and Lucretius, all of whom had plenty to say about what they regarded as religious flummery. And so, in a curious fashion, did Harriet Beecher Stowe, not because she was a satirist or a skeptic like the others, but because her younger brother, the Reverend Henry Ward Beecher, was the central figure in an absolutely volcanic church-sex scandal in the 1870’s, a news event, by the way, that historians tell us generated more press coverage and comment than anything had since the civil war. I don’t mean to suggest that we as a society or as individuals should become complacent about serious wrongdoing. What I mean to suggest is that only when you have some feeling for our unremittingly accident-prone past as a species are you able to put present conduct in some perspective. Only then are you able to see, as Chaucer did, say, what is familiar and funny and poignant about the Wife of Bath, as distinct from trying to book her on a felony. History helps guard against moral smugness too, or it should, anyway. For you are obliged, if you are honest, to acknowledge at least some reflection or resonance of the fallen ones in your own nature. Such humility is a conspicuously missing aspect of our contemporary culture, however. What might be a becoming spell of moral introspection, tends instead to become an orgy of bashing and blaming. I observe that now, as always in this country, when people speak of a terrible, all embracing decline in ethical standards, they are invariably speaking of the decline in their next door neighbor’s standards, not their own. Such are the ultimate wages of ignoring human history, which is to say, ignoring who we are. But look out: for the flip side of this failure has some dangers of its own. I am thinking of those analysts who know a little history but misuse it. These are the half-baked determinists, fatalists and dead-enders of our society who, knowing that there are historical precedents for certain broad categories of current behavior, cite this fact as proof that there is not further purpose in thinking about the present at all. They create a kind of quasi-historical rationale for the dismissive, “everybody does it” argument. I mean, “Hell, Agamemnon did it, what’s the big deal about Nixon?” This tendency also comes in a cyclical variation. It is worth pondering here that while the day, the month and the year all exist in nature and were there all along for us to discern, the week is essentially a human invention. There are no Wednesdays in nature. It was we who created life as a vista of endlessly recurring Wednesdays - Wednesdays without end. This being one of the fundamental human methods of bringing order, or at least an illusion of order, out of chaos. Just so, there is much temptation in journalism to yield to a kind of convenient here-it-comes-again, Ferris wheel principle of organizing and interpreting experience. It is thanks to this custom, of course, that your much-maligned generation is seen as an all-points-perfect recreation of my own much-maligned generation, one full turn of the Ferris wheel. Do not be tempted by the cycle trap. It results in blurring exactly those distinctions you should be looking for. I can show you, for example, an article I wrote more than 25 years ago about a then current wallow in talk of an American moral collapse; the great moral collapse of the late 1950s. It was about three great moral collapses ago, but it was a doozy. Just as now, it had money-mad athletes, crooked businessmen, worldly churchmen, corrupt professionals, a middle-class that loved its household goods too well, lying, cheating, and all around abysmal behavior. All this was ceaselessly talked about and condemned, and some of it was even true. But what we are observing today is in key respects different from all that. Such a past is worth study as an aid to discovering those differences and thus understanding our own condition better, but not as quest for reassurance that we may be no better than most, but are no worse, either. This, in large measure, is what respectable - and, yes, honorable - journalism requires. First finding out, and then working as fairly and unflaggingly as you can to isolate and understand the precedents, the relationships and the distinctiveness, the individually, of the figures and events in the landscape you are putting before your readers. I could tell you a dozen ways in which the public leaders currently in hot water are different from those who were in hot water about a quarter of a century ago, and an equal number of ways in which the moral atmosphere is different - in some but not all of them insidiously worse. I could also show you a dozen ways in which, based on my own observation, this generation of young people is doing good, not just doing well, in ways that bespeak an intelligence and generosity of spirit that their predecessors, including those of the much romanticized sixties, ought to envy. But it is the discipline for discerning these things, not the endless example, that concerns me here. And now having pronounced you all honorary journalists, let me offer one final guiding phrase for your career. Some years back the critic John Malcolm Brinnin wrote a book about Dylan Thomas which embodied a faithful but very particular perception of the poet, one that stressed his sad, last, drunken, coming apart days in New York. It was an affront to Thomas’s widow and she engaged in heated exchange with the critic. I have always remembered her phrasing because I found it so arresting and right, and I always commend it to would-be journalists. Caitlin Thomas did not say that Brinnin had told lies, or that what he had reported had not occurred. She did not say he was in any narrow or measurable sense “wrong,” because he was not. She said, and this is the phrase: I know a better truth than Brinnin’s. As the dispute over Dylan Thomas’s life and his last days still goes on, and as his widow herself I fear has made her own contribution to the confusion, it would be foolish to assume that her “better truth” is the right one. But the phrase, the conception is the right one for us. A better truth, not necessarily a more positive or friendly or comfortable one, or even a contradictory truth, but one that is larger, roomier, more complex and more authentic than any one-shot version can be. That is what journalism, yours and mine, ideally will be about. Keep the faith. Do the profession proud. We need all the help we can get.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"Mr. President – at last I can say that with pleasure – and administrators of the university and all its schools – their family, friends and significant others – Faculty with tenure. Faculty without tenure – Parents and families of graduates. Step parents and chosen family of graduates – and anyone else who helped pay the bills – Friends and lovers of graduates (you know who you are) – Also students who someday will graduate, returning graduates, and people who just stopped by to watch because, like me, you are commencement junkies – Staff members who house, feed and maintain all of the above, as well as preparing this ceremony – And most of all, graduates, co-conspirators and subversives – Those who were born before June 1, 1965, and those born after – Those who lived uphill, or downhill, or met in the Pagoda – Fletcher graduates, who have the revolutionary idea that law might have a relationship to justice, and diplomacy to the truth – Graduates who will build buildings that last longer than we do, or teeth that last as long as we do–a new event in human history – Those who will cure illness, promote wellness, and save our environment, and who will extend a helping hand to the other living creatures on this Spaceship Earth – In short, to everyone who shares this day as the celebration of one journey and the beginning of another, I say thank you for letting me share it with you. Because I confess that I am terminally sentimental about graduations. They are more individual than weddings, more conscious than christenings, or bar mitzvahs or bat mitzvahs. They are almost as much a step into the unknown as funerals – though I assure you, there is life after graduation. In fact, ceremonies like these get to me every time. And today is all the more momentous for the extraordinary group with whom I share honorary degrees. Please read about their work and lives and be as instructed as I have been. As someone who tried (unsuccessfully) to dance her way out of Toledo, Ohio, and into the hearts of Americans, I have always wanted to meet Katherine Dunham. She brought dance out of its artsy ghetto, just as Natalie Davis had the revolutionary idea that ordinary people should be part of history – and vice versa. I thank David McCord for being a rare man who loves both children and poetry. And I thank the spirit of the late Danny Kaye, who made us laugh with, never at, each other. Dr. Callow has helped our bodies through his craft and our minds through his aid to this university. Claude Shannon seems to me a kind of Zeus from whose forehead springs technology fullblown, communicative and user-friendly. Winston Lord bridges worlds through diplomacy, just as C. S. Ioh combines art with commerce and business with conscience. I thank Dr. Ames for managing to rescue both people from cancer and animals from pain. It is an extraordinary group. But I especially want to thank Supreme Court Justice Blackmun, who extended a U.S. Constitution written for, by and about white males to protect the reproductive freedom of women of all races. Because a fervent minority of Americans still disagree with women’s rights and ability to make a conscientious decision about abortion, Justice Blackmun continues to live under hurtful attacks. So I would like to publicly thank him on behalf of the more than 70 percent of Americans who agree with the decision he authored, who believe that a woman’s life is also a human life, and who know that the majority decision he wrote may have saved the lives and health of more women in this country than any other single act in history. One day soon, reproductive freedom – that is, the freedom to have or not have children, without government interference – will be recognized as a basic human right, like freedom of speech or assembly. Then, history will also thank Justice Blackmun. But just in case the honor of this company and this occasion might endanger my humility, here is a note of reality: I don’t remember one single thing my own commencement speaker said. I was consumed with concern about how my friends would get on with my family, and vice versa; about how I was going to pack four years of possessions into one car; and about how I was not going to get married to the very tempting man I was then engaged to – (In the ’50s, everybody got married or engaged before or right after graduation – but I wanted to go off to India instead). Furthermore, I conducted a small survey in preparation for today. Half of my sample couldn’t remember who their commencement speaker was. So instead of pursuing one theme that might exclude many people, I’m going to be diverse in the hope of leaving a sentence or two that might be useful to more people. All these thoughts come under the general heading of “what I know now that I wish I’d known then.” One other organizing principle I will leave to the end–and I defy you to guess what it is. I’ve also tried to follow Henny Youngman’s wisdom – he always told one-liners because longer jokes weren’t, as he put it, “worth the trip” – by keeping each thought short. For instance: Thought 1: A person who has experienced something is almost always far more expert on it than are the experts. A corollary is that any process including only experts, with no contribution from those with personal experience, will probably go wrong. An extension is that our educational system is long on book learning, but short on apprenticeship. A further extension is that our social policy is long on theorists, and short on organizers. A national example: The poverty programs of the Johnson Administration were less successful than the Depression projects of the Roosevelt Administration in part because the first were mostly designed by Washington poverticians, while the second were mostly local initiatives that were given government support. For a personal example: I wish someone had warned me that book learning, as valuable and irreplaceable as it may be, can also make you self-critical, reverential and otherwise fearful of acting. (Of course, this is especially true if you are female, or a different race or ethnicity, and nobody in the books looks like you – but I hope you have had more inclusive textbooks than I did). So whatever you want to do, just do it. Don’t worry about making a damn fool of yourself. Making a damn fool of yourself is absolutely essential. And you will have a great time. Thought 2: When I was a student, we used to sit around discussing whether a particular end justified a particular means. On the assumption of everyone from Marx or Machiavelli, I thought that was the question. It took me twenty years to figure out that the means are the ends – and vice versa. Whatever means you use become an organic part of the ends you achieve. For example: Groups rarely benefit from revolutions if they haven’t been an organic part of that revolution. Even if they are given certain paper rights at the end of the process, they may remain too weak to use them. Strength comes from process. Process is all. Thought 3: If you have to choose character or intelligence – in a friend or in a candidate – choose character. Intelligence without character is dangerous, but character without intelligence only slows down a good result. Thought 4: Politics is not just what goes on in the electoral system, or in Washington. Politics is any power relationship in our daily lives. Anytime one human being is habitually powerful over another, or one group over another, not because of talent or experience, but just because of race, or sex or class, that’s politics. So when we look at the fields of your state and mind, and see that one color of human beings owns them, and another color works on them as migrant labor, that’s politics. When we find a hundred of one kind of human being in the typing pool, and a few of another in the boardroom, that’s politics. When children have only their father’s name,that’s politics. When most men have only one job, while most women have two – one inside the home and one outside it – that’s politics, too. And when students of color are still in smaller proportion than are people of color in the population, or women are a lesser percentage of dentists and engineers, or men a lesser proportion of physical therapists and nutritionists, that’s politics. Forget old definitions. They were based on the idea that what happened to men was politics, and what happened to women was culture. That division was just a way of keeping certain parts of life immune to change. In fact, the personal is very often political. And revolutions, like houses, get built from the bottom up, not the top down. Thought 5: As Margaret Mead once said, “Marriage worked well in the 19th Century because people only lived to be fifty.” Because life expectancy has increased about thirty years since 1900, there are bound to be different ways of living. Some people will marry and raise children young, then go off amicably for another life of a different accomplishment. Some will marry late – after their work lives are well under way – and have children later or not at all. Some will not marry, or will love and live with a partner of the same gender. Others will raise their children among a chosen family of friends, or find colleagues in work and shared ideals who are their spiritual family. As the prison of form diminishes, we can pay more attention to content. That means equal power between partners and thus the possibility of free choice. That means commitment out of decision, not desperation or pressure. That means kindness, empathy and nurturing – because those of us who are not parents can help those who are. We can have children as friends. If that sounds Pollyanna-ish, consider that the foreshadowings of such a change are with us now. Women in the paid workforce – and hopefully men who are real parents, too – are finally beginning to bring the reality of children’s lives into the public sphere. This is long overdue: The United States is the only industrialized democracy in the world that behaves as if children didn’t exist until the age of six. Furthermore, the divorce rate has begun to decline, an event that feminists have always predicted. When people used to say to me, “Feminism is the cause of divorce,” I always said, “No, marriage is the cause of divorce.” Forcing all people to believe they had to live one way was the cause of many bad marriages, just as forcing all people to believe they had to be parents was the cause of many bad parents and unhappy children. No one way of living can be right for all people. So the message is: Don’t worry if your life doesn’t look like a Dick-and-Jane primer. Don’t worry if it doesn’t look like the Yuppie opposite of a Dick-and-Jane primer. The point is less what we choose, than that we have the power to make a choice. Thought 6: Remember the ’50s and ’60s? Then, women were supposed to marry what we wanted to become–as in, “Marry a doctor, don’t be one.” In the ’70s and ’80s, some women started to say, “We are becoming the men we wanted to marry.” But in the ’90s, more men must become the womenthey wanted to marry. I’ll know we’re getting someplace when as many young men as young women ask, “How can I combine career and family?” And men will be getting someplace, too. They won’t be strangers to their children anymore. They won’t be suppressing qualities in themselves that are human but not stereotypically masculine. They will even be living longer, since the pressures of having to win, or even be aggressive or violent, all lead to the clear conclusion that the prison of the so-called masculine role is the killer of many men. This isn’t a role exchange – it’s a humanization of both roles. For both women and men, progress probably lies in the direction we haven’t been. For women, it may lie in becoming more active in public life. For men, it may lie in playing a real part of private life. But for both, the pleasure and reward is becoming a whole human being. I wish I had realized this earlier. It means progress is not always a straight line, in which we must defeat or outstrip others and there is only one winner. Progress is a circle in which we strive to use all our talents and complete ourselves. Potentially, we are all winners. Thought 7: Don’t forget to give at least ten percent of everything you earn to social change. It’s the best investment you’ll ever make. Possessions can be lost, broken or begin to possess you. Indeed, if you’re really happy in your life and work, you won’t have that much time to shop and buy and re-buy and repair anyway. The money you save may not be worth that much tomorrow. Insurance companies may cancel your policies. Tithing is the pioneer example and the religious example. Helping others is the only way to be sure there will be someone there to help you. Finally, the last thought and an organizing principle of this list of I-wish-I-had-knowns: the reason why acting on such thoughts is timely and vital right now. Economists are warning, and politicians are fearing, that this nation is at the end of its economic expansionist period. There are now other countries that can compete or even outstrip us in productivity. For the first time, 80 percent of Americans have not increased their real buying power in the last ten years, and many young people will not do as well in conventional economic terms as their parents. Most authorities see this as a time of danger–and that is true. Energies deflected from earning more and buying more could cause us to fly apart politically. But this is also an opportunity to make real changes in our lives and in our country. It is time for America to become known for the quality of life as well as the quantity of goods. It is time to carry out the greatest mission and legacy of our culture: that we are the world’s biggest experiment in multi-cultural and multi-racial living. Our fragile planet needs to learn exactly this lesson of cherishing each other’s differences. This campus is imperfect, but it is far better than the world outside it, and the world could be much more like it–with politicians as open to visitors as are the deans in the hall I face; women heading newspapers and governments as they do here, and commitment to mutual support and non-violence. Bigger is not better. America’s military might is not our best legacy. Equality is the best insurance against the political upheaval that authorities fear. More than 70 percent of Americans say they are willing to change their standard of living in conventional economic terms–providing this so-called “sacrifice” is evenly spread. This is a turning point in history – and your challenge. Our hearts go with you. Our heads and hands are here to help you. The brotherhood of man and the sisterhood of women – the humanity of people – is “not so wild a dream as those who profit by delaying it would have us believe.” One more point. This is the last period of time that will seem lengthy to you at only 3 or 4 years. From now on, time will pass without artificial academic measure. It will go by like the wind. Whatever you want to do, do it now. For life is time, and time is all there is.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"I am of course overjoyed to be here today in the role of ceremonial object. There is more than the usual amount of satisfaction in receiving an honorary degree from the university that helped to form one’s erstwhile callow and ignorant mind into the thing of dubious splendor that it is today; whose professors put up with so many overdue term papers, and struggled to read one’s handwriting, of which ‘interesting’ is the best that has been said; at which one failed to learn Anglo-Saxon and somehow missed Bibliography entirely, a severe error which I trust no one present here today has committed; and at which one underwent excruciating agonies not only of soul but of body, later traced to having drunk too much coffee in the bowels of Wymilwood. It is to Victoria College that I can attribute the fact that Bell Canada, Oxford University Press and McClelland and Stewart all failed to hire me in the summer of ‘63, on the grounds that I was a) overqualified and b) couldn’t type, thus producing in me that state of joblessness, angst and cosmic depression which everyone knows is indispensable for novelists and poets, although nobody has ever claimed the same for geologists, dentists or chartered accountants. It is also due to Victoria College, incarnated in the person of Northrop Frye, that I didn’t run away to England to become a waitress, live in a garret, write masterpieces and get tuberculosis. He thought I might have more spare time for creation if I ran away to Boston, lived in a stupor, wrote footnotes and got anxiety attacks, that is, if I went to Graduate School, and he was right. So, for all the benefits conferred upon me by my Alma Mater, where they taught me that the truth would make me free but failed to warn me of the kind of trouble I’d get into by trying to tell it - I remain duly grateful. But everything has its price. No sooner had I tossed off a graceful reply to the letter inviting me to be present today than I began to realize the exorbitance of what was expected of me. I was going to have to come up with something to say,to a graduating class in 1983, year of the Ph.D. taxi driver, when young people have unemployment the way they used to have ugly blackheads; something presumably useful, wise, filled with resonance and overview, helpful, encouraging and optimistic. After all, you are being launched - though ever since I experienced the process, I’ve wondered why “convocation” is the name for it. “Ejection” would be better. Even in the best of times, it’s more or less like being pushed over a cliff, and these are not the best of times. In case you haven’t figured it out already, I’m here to tell you that it’s an armpit out there. As for your university degree, there are definitely going to be days when you will feel that you’ve been given a refrigerator and sent to the middle of a jungle, where there are no three-pronged grounded plugholes. Not only that, the year will come when you will wake up in the middle of the night and realize that the people you went to school with are in positions of power, and may soon actually be running things. If there’s anything more calculated to thick men’s blood with cold, it’s that. After all, you know how much they didn’t know then, and, given yourself as an example, you can’t assume they know a great deal more now. “We’re all doomed,” you will think. (For example: Brian Mulroney is only a year older than I am.) You may feel that the only thing to do when you’ve reached this stage is to take up nail-biting, mantras, or jogging, all of which would be recognized by animal behavior specialists as substitution activities, like scratching, which are resorted to in moments of unresolved conflict. But we’ll get around to some positive thinking in a moment. “What shall I tell them!” I thought, breaking out into a cold sweat, as I tossed and turned night after night. (Lest you leap to indulge in Calvinistic guilt at the idea of having been the proximate cause of my discomfort, let me hasten to add that I was on a boat. The tossing and turning was par for the course, and the cold sweat can be cured by Gravol). For a while I toyed with the idea of paraphrasing Kurt Vonnegut, who told one graduating class, “Everything is going to become unbelievably worse and will never get better again,” and walked off the stage. But that’s the American style: boom or bust. A Canadian would be more apt to say, “things may be pretty mediocre but let’s at least try to hold the line.” Then I thought that maybe I could say a few words on the subject of a liberal arts education, and how it prepares you for life. But sober reflection led me to the conclusion that this topic too was a washout; for, as you will soon discover, a liberal arts education doesn’t exactly prepare you for life. A preparation-for-life curriculum would not consist of courses on Victorian Thought and French Romanticism, but of things like How to Cope With Marital Breakdown, Getting More for your Footwear Dollar, Dealing With Stress, and How To Keep Your Fingernails from Breaking Off by Always Filing Them Towards the Center; in other words, it would read like the contents page of Homemakers Magazine, which is why Homemakers Magazine is so widely read, even by me. Or, for boys, Forbes or The Economist , and Improving Your Place in the Power Hierarchy by Choosing the Right Suit. (Dark blue with a faint white pinstripe, not too far apart, in case you’re interested.) Or maybe, I thought, I should expose glaring errors in the educational system, or compile a list of things I was taught which are palpably not true. For instance, in high school I made the mistake of taking Home Economics instead of Typing - we thought, in those days, that if you took the commercial course most of your eyebrows would come off and would have to be drawn on with a pencil for the rest of your life - where I was told that every meal should consist of a brown thing, a white thing, a yellow thing and a green thing; that it was not right to lick the spoon while cooking; and that the inside of a dress seam was as important as the outside. All three of these ideas are false and should be discarded immediately by anyone who still holds them. Nor did anyone have the foresight to inform me that the best thing I could do for myself as a writer would be back and wrist exercises. No one has yet done a study of this, but they will, and when they start excavating and measuring the spines and arm bones of the skeletons of famous writers of the past I am sure they will find that those who wrote the longest novels, such as Dickens and Melville, also had the thickest wrists. The real reason that Emily Dickinson stuck to lyric poems with relatively few stanzas is that she had spindly fingers. You may scoff, but future research will prove me right. But I then thought, I shouldn’t talk about writing. Few of this graduating class will wish to be writers, and those that do should by no means be encouraged. Weave a circle round them thrice, and close your eyes holy dread, because who needs the competition? What with the proliferation of Creative Writing courses, a mushroom of recent growth all but unknown in my youth, we will soon have a state of affairs in which everybody writes and nobody reads, the exact reverse of the way things were when I was composing dolorous verses in a rented cupboard on Charles Street in the early sixties. Or maybe, I thought, I should relate to them a little known fact of shocking import, which they will remember vividly when they have all but forgotten the rest of this speech. For example: nobody ever tells you, but did you know that when you have a baby your hair falls out? Not all of it, and not all at once, but it does fall out. It has something to do with a zinc imbalance. The good news is that it does grow back in. This only applies to girls. With boys, it falls out whether you have a baby or not, and it never grows back in; but even then there is hope. In a pinch, you can resort to quotation, a commodity which a liberal arts education teaches you to treat with respect, and I offer the following: “God only made a few perfect heads, and the rest lie covered with hair.” Which illustrates the following point: when faced with the inevitable, you always have a choice. You may not be able to alter reality, but you can alter your attitude towards it. As I learned during my liberal arts education, any symbol can have, in the imaginative context, two versions, a positive and a negative. Blood can either be the gift of life or what comes out of you when you cut your wrists in the bathtub. Or, somewhat less drastically, if you spill your milk you’re left with a glass which is either half empty or half full. Which brings us to the hidden agenda of this speech. What you are being ejected into today is a world that is both half empty and half full. On the one hand, the biosphere is rotting away. The raindrops that keep falling on your head are also killing the fish, the trees, the animals, and, if they keep being as acid as they are now, they’ll eventually do away with things a lot closer to home, such as crops, front lawns and your digestive tract. Nature is no longer what surrounds us, we surround it, and the switch has not been for the better. On the other hand, unlike the ancient Egyptians, we as a civilization know what mistakes we are making and we also have the technology to stop making them; all that is lacking is the will. Another example: on the one hand, we ourselves live daily with the threat of annihilation. We’re just a computer button and a few minutes away from it, and the gap between us and it is narrowing every day. We secretly think in terms not of “If the Bomb Drops” but of “When the Bomb Drops”, and it’s understandable if we sometimes let ourselves slide into a mental state of powerlessness and consequent apathy. On the other hand, the catastrophe that threatens us as a species, and most other species as well, is not unpredictable and uncontrollable, like the eruption of the volcano that destroyed Pompeii. If it occurs, we can die with the dubious satisfaction of knowing that the death of the world was a man-made and therefore preventable event, and that the failure to prevent it was a failure of human will. This is the kind of world we find ourselves in, and it’s not pleasant. Faced with facts this depressing, the question of the economy - or how many of us in this country can afford two cars doesn’t really loom too large, but you’d never know it from reading the papers. Things are in fact a lot worse elsewhere, where expectations center not on cars and houses and jobs but on the next elusive meal. That’s part of the down side. The up side, here and now, is that this is still more or less a democracy; you don’t get shot or tortured yet for expressing an opinion, and politicians, motivated as they may be by greed and the lust for power, are nevertheless or because of this, still swayed by public opinion. The issues raised in any election are issues perceived by those who want power to be of importance to those in a position to confer it upon them. In other words, if enough people show by the issues they raise and by the way they’re willing to vote that they want changes made, then change becomes possible. You may not be able to alter reality, but you can alter your attitude towards it, and this, paradoxically, alters reality. Try it and see.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"I want to thank the Mills College Class of ‘83 for offering me a rare chance: to speak aloud in public in the language of women. I know there are men graduating, and I don’t mean to exclude them, far from it. There is a Greek tragedy where the Greek says to the foreigner, “If you don’t understand Greek, please signify by nodding.” Anyhow, commencements are usually operated under the unspoken agreement that everybody graduating is either male or ought to be. That’s why we are all wearing these twelfth-century dresses that look so great on men and make women look either like a mushroom or a pregnant stork. Intellectual tradition is male. Public speaking is done in the public tongue, the national or tribal language; and the language of our tribe is the men’s language. Of course women learn it. We’re not dumb. If you can tell Margaret Thatcher from Ronald Reagan, or Indira Gandhi from General Somoza, by anything they say, tell me how. This is a man’s world, so it talks a man’s language. The words are all words of power. You’ve come a long way, baby, but no way is long enough. You can’t even get there by selling yourself out: because there is theirs, not yours. Maybe we’ve had enough words of power and talk about the battle of life. Maybe we need some words of weakness. Instead of saying now that I hope you will all go forth from this ivory tower of college into the Real World and forge a triumphant career or at least help your husband to and keep our country strong and be a success in everything - instead of talking about power, what if I talked like a woman right here in public? It won’t sound right. It’s going to sound terrible. What if I said what I hope for you is first, if – only if – you want kids, I hope you have them. Not hordes of them. A couple, enough. I hope they’re beautiful. I hope you and they have enough to eat, and a place to be warm and clean in, and friends, and work you like doing. Well, is that what you went to college for? Is that all? What about success? Success is somebody else’s failure. Success is the American Dream we can keep dreaming because most people in most places, including thirty million of ourselves, live wide awake in the terrible reality of poverty. No, I do not wish you success. I don’t even want to talk about it. I want to talk about failure. Because you are human beings you are going to meet failure. You are going to meet disappointment, injustice, betrayal, and irreparable loss. You will find you’re weak where you thought yourself strong. You’ll work for possessions and then find they possess you. You will find yourself - as I know you already have - in dark places, alone, and afraid. What I hope for you, for all my sisters and daughters, brothers and sons, is that you will be able to live there, in the dark place. To live in the place that our rationalizing culture of success denies, calling it a place of exile, uninhabitable, foreign. Well, we’re already foreigners. Women as women are largely excluded from, alien to, the self-declared male norms of this society, where human beings are called Man, the only respectable god is male, the only direction is up. So that’s their country; let’s explore our own. I’m not talking about sex; that’s a whole other universe, where every man and woman is on their own. I’m talking about society, the so-called man’s world of institutionalized competition, aggression, violence, authority, and power. If we want to live as women, some separatism is forced upon us: Mills College is a wise embodiment of that separatism. The war-games world wasn’t made by us or for us; we can’t even breathe the air there without masks. And if you put the mask on you’ll have a hard time getting it off. So how about going on doing things our own way, as to some extent you did here at Mills? Not for men and the male power hierarchy - that’s their game. Not against men, either - that’s still playing by their rules. But with any men who are with us: that’s our game. Why should a free woman with a college education either fight Macho-man or serve him? Why should she live her life on his terms? Macho-man is afraid of our terms, which are not all rational, positive, competitive, etc. And so he has taught us to despise and deny them. In our society, women have lived, and have been despised for living, the whole side of life that includes and takes responsibility for helplessness, weakness, and illness, for the irrational and the irreparable, for all that is obscure, passive, uncontrolled, animal, unclean - the valley of the shadow, the deep, the depths of life. All that the Warrior denies and refuses is left to us and the men who share it with us and therefore, like us, can’t play doctor, only nurse, can’t be warriors, only civilians, can’t be chiefs, only indians. Well, so that is our country. The night side of our country. If there is a day side to it, high sierras, prairies of bright grass, we only know pioneers’ tales about it, we haven’t got there yet. We’re never going to get there by imitating Macho-man. We are only going to get there by going our own way, by living there, by living through the night in our own country. So what I hope for you is that you live there not as prisoners, ashamed of being women, consenting captives of a psychopathic social system, but as natives. That you will be at home there, keep house there, be your own mistress, with a room of your own. That you will do your work there, whatever you’re good at, art or science or tech or running a company or sweeping under the beds, and when they tell you that it’s second-class work because a woman is doing it, I hope you tell them to go to hell and while they’re going to give you equal pay for equal time. I hope you live without the need to dominate, and without the need to be dominated. I hope you are never victims, but I hope you have no power over other people. And when you fail, and are defeated, and in pain, and in the dark, then I hope you will remember that darkness is your country, where you live, where no wars are fought and no wars are won, but where the future is. Our roots are in the dark; the earth is our country. Why did we look up for blessing - instead of around, and down? What hope we have lies there. Not in the sky full of orbiting spy-eyes and weaponry, but in the earth we have looked down upon. Not from above, but from below. Not in the light that blinds, but in the dark that nourishes, where human beings grow human souls.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"Ever since it was announced that a non-doctor, in fact an actor, had been invited to give the commencement address at one of the most prestigious medical schools in the country people have been wondering: “Why get someone who only pretends to be a doctor when you could get a real one?” Some people have suggested that this school had done everything it could to show you how to be doctors and in a moment of desperation had brought in someone who could show you how to act like one. It’s certainly true that I’m not a doctor. I have a long list of non-qualifications. In the first place I’m not a great fan of blood. I don’t mind people’s having it, I just don’t enjoy seeing them wear it. I have yet to see a real operation because the mere smell of a hospital reminds me of a previous appointment. And my knowledge of anatomy resides in the clear understanding that the hip bone is connected to the leg bone. I am not a doctor. But you have asked me, and all in all, I think you made a wonderful choice. I say that because I probably first came to the attention of this graduating class through a character on television that I’ve played and helped write for the past seven years: a surgeon called Hawkeye Pierce. He’s a remarkable person, this Hawkeye, and if you have chosen somehow to associate his character with your own graduation from medical school, then I find that very heartening because I think it means that you are reaching out toward a very human kind of doctoring. And a very real kind of doctor. We didn’t make him up. He really lived as several doctors who struggled to preserve life 25 years ago during the Korean War. In fact, it’s because he’s based on real doctors that there is something especially engaging about him. He has a sense of humor and yet he’s serious…he’s impertinent and yet he has feeling…he’s human enough to make mistakes, and yet he hates death enough to push himself past his own limits to save lives. In many ways, he’s the doctor patients want to have and doctors want to be. But he’s not an idealization. Finding himself in a war, he’s sometimes angry, sometimes cynical, sometimes a little nuts. He’s not a magician who can come up with an instant cure for a rare disease without sweating and ruining his makeup. He knows he might fail. Not a god, he walks gingerly on the edge of disaster – alive to his own mortality. If this image of that very human, very caring doctor is attractive to you – if it’s ever touched you for a moment as something to reach for in your own life – then I’m here to cheer you on: Do it. Go for it. Be skilled, be learned, be aware of the dignity of your calling…but please don’t ever lose sight of your own simple humanity. Unfortunately, that may not be so easy. You’re entering a special place in our society. People will be awed by your expertise. You’ll be placed in a position of privilege. You’ll live well, people will defer to you, call you by your title – and it may be hard to remember that the word “doctor” is not actually your first name. I know what this is like to some extent because in some ways you and I are alike. We both study the human being. And we both try to offer relief you through medicine, and I through laughter – but we both try to reduce suffering. We’ve both learned difficult disciplines that have taken years to master, and we’ve both dedicated ourselves to years of hard work. And we both charge a lot. We live in a society that has decided to reward my profession and yours, when we succeed in them, very highly. It can sometimes be easy to forget that the cab driver also works 14 or 15 hours a day and is also drained of energy when he’s through. It’s easy to think that because our society grants us privilege that we’re entitled to it. Privilege feels good, but it can be intoxicating. As good doctors, I hope you’ll be able to keep yourselves free of toxins. It’s no wonder, though, that people will hold you in awe. I know I do. You’ve spent years in a grueling effort to know the structure and process of human life. I can’t imagine a more difficult task. It has required the understanding of complexities within complexities, and there has been more pressure placed on you in four years than most people would be willing to take in a lifetime. I stand here in utter amazement at what you’ve accomplished. And I congratulate you. I only ask one thing of you: Possess your skills, but don’t be possessed by them. Certainly your training has encouraged you to see the human side of your work, and you’ve examined the doctor-patient relationship. But still, the enormity of your task has required you to focus to such an extent on technique and data that you may not have had time enough to face your feelings along the way. You’ve had to toughen yourself to death. From your first autopsy when you may have been sick, or cried or just been numb, you’ve had to inure yourself to death in order to be useful to the living. But I hope in the process you haven’t done too good a job of burying that part of you that hurts and is afraid. I know what it’s like to be absorbed in technique. When I write for M*A*S*H, I’m always writing about people in crisis with what I hope is compassion and feeling. And yet one day I found myself talking to someone who was in a real crisis and real pain – and I remember thinking, “This would make a great story.” Both of these things – becoming set apart and becoming your skill – can make it tough to be a compassionate person. All right, that’s my diagnosis of the problem. Here’s my prescription: I’d like to suggest to you, just in case you haven’t done it lately, that this would be a very good time to give some thought to just exactly what your values are, and then to figure out how you’re going to live by them. Knowing what you care about and then devoting yourself to it is just about the only way you can pick your way through the minefield of existence and come out in one piece. It can be a startling experience when you try to rank your values, though. Just ask yourself what’s the most important thing in the world to you. Your work? Your family? Your money? Your country? Getting to heaven? Sex? Dope? Alcohol? What? (I don’t need a show of hands on this.) Then when you get the answer to that, ask yourself how much time you actually spend on your number one value – and how much time you spend on what you thought was number five, or number ten. What, in fact, is the thing you value most? It may not be easy to decide. We live in a time that seems to be split about its values. In fact it seems to be schizophrenic. For instance, if you pick up a magazine like “Psychology Today,” you’re liable to see an article like: “White Collar Crime: It’s More Widespread Than You Think.” Then in the back of the magazine they’ll print an advertisement that says, “We’ll write your doctoral thesis for 25 bucks.” You see how values are eroding? I mean, a doctoral thesis ought to go for at least a C-note. The question is where are their values? What do they value? Unfortunately, the people we look to for leadership seem to be providing it by negative example. All across the country this month commencement speakers are saying to graduating classes, “We look to you for tomorrow’s leaders.” That’s because today’s leaders are all in jail. Maybe we can afford to let politicians operate in a moral vacuum, but we can’t afford to let doctors operate under those conditions. You know how we’re feeling these days as the power and fuel monopoly has its way with us. Well, you people graduating today are entering a very select group. You have a monopoly on medical care. Please be careful not to abuse this power that you have over the rest of us. You need to know what you care about most and what you care about least. And you need to know now. You will be making life and death decisions and you will often be making them under stress and with great speed. The time to make your tender choices is not in the heat of the moment. When you’re making your list, let me urge you to put people first. And I include in that not just people, but that which exists between people. I suggest to you that what makes people know they’re alive – and in some cases keeps them alive – is not merely the interaction of the parts of their bodies, but the interaction of their selves with other selves. Let me challenge you. With all your study, you can name all the bones in my body. You can read my X-rays like a telegram. But can you read my involuntary muscles? Can you see the fear and uncertainty in my face? If I tell you where it hurts, can you hear in my voice where I ache? I show you my body but I bring you my person. Can you see me through your reading glasses? Will you tell me what you’re doing, and in words I can understand? Will you tell me when you don’t know what to do? Can you face your own fear, your own uncertainty? When in doubt, can you call in help? These are things to consider even if you don’t deal directly with patients. If you’re in research, administration, if you write – no matter what you do – eventually there is always going to be a patient at the other end of your decisions. Now, of course, everyone is for this in principle. Who’s against people? But it gets harder when you get specific. Will you be the kind of doctor who cares more about the case than the person? (“Nurse, call the gastric ulcer and have him come in at three.”… “How’s the fractured femur in Room 208?”) You’ll know you’re in trouble if you find yourself wishing they would mail you their liver in a plain brown envelope. Where does money come on your list? Will it be the sole standard against which you reckon your success? How much will it guide you in relating to your patients? Do patients in a clinic need less of your attention than private patients? Are they, for instance, less in need of having things explained to them? Where will your family come on your list? How many days and nights, weeks and months, will you separate yourself from them, buried in your work, before you realize that you’ve removed yourself from an important part of your life? And if you’re a male doctor how will you relate to women? Women as patients, as nurses, as fellow doctors – and later as students. Will you be able to respect your patient’s right to know and make decisions about her own body? Will you see nurses as colleagues – or as handmaidens? And if the day comes when you are teaching, what can young women medical students expect from you? Questionnaires filled out by women at 41 medical schools around the country have revealed a distressing pattern. The women were often either ignored in class or simply not taken seriously as students. They were told that they were only there to find a husband and that they were taking the places of men who would then have to go out and become chiropractors. (Logic is not the strong point of sexism.) They were often told that women just didn’t belong in medicine. And at times they were told this by the very professors who were grading them. They would be shown slides of Playboy nudes during anatomy lectures – to the accompaniment of catcalls and wisecracks from male students. And in place of discussions about their work, they would often hear a discussion of their appearance. These are reports from 41 different medical schools. I’m dwelling on this because it seems to me that the male­female relationship is still the most personal and intense test of humane behavior. It is a crucible for decency. I hope you men will work to grant the same dignity to your female colleagues that you yourselves enjoy. And if you’re a female doctor, I hope you’ll be aware that you didn’t get where you are all by yourself. You’ve had to work hard, of course. But you’re sitting where you are right now in part because way back in 1848 in Seneca Falls women you never knew began insisting you had a right to sit there. Just as they helped a generation they would never see, I urge you to work for the day when your daughters and their daughters will be called not “a woman doctor,” or “my doctor, who’s a woman…” but simply, “my doctor.” It may seem strange to rank the things you care about, but when you think about it, there isn’t an area of your work that won’t be affected by what you decide to place a high value on and what you decide doesn’t count. Decide now. Well, that’s my prescription. I’ve given you kind of a big pill to swallow, but I think it’ll make you feel better. And if not – well, look, I’m only human. I congratulate you, and please let me thank you for taking on the enormous responsibility that you have – and for having the strength to have made it to this day. I don’t know how you’ve managed to learn it all. But there is one more thing you can learn about the body that only a non­doctor would tell you – and I hope you’ll always remember this: The head bone is connected to the heart bone – and don’t let them come apart.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"Dinner, let us imagine, has reached its second wine. We are exchanging pleasantries: gossip, tittle-tattle, perilously keen remarks. Like a fine sauce, they pique the mind. They pass the time. A thought is peeled and placed upon a plate. A nearby lady lends us a small smile, and there are glances brilliant as the silver. Patiently we listen while another talks, because everyone, our etiquette instructs, must have his chance to speak. We wait. We draw upon the cloth with unused knives. Our goblets turn as slowly as the world. And on this beautiful ceremonial morning I want to talk to you about talking, that commonest of all our intended activities, for talking is our public link with one another; it is a need; it is an art; it is the chief instrument of all instruction; it is the most personal aspect of our private life. To those who have sponsored our appearance in the world, the first memorable moment to follow our inaugural bawl is the birth of our first word. It is that noise, a sound that is no longer a simple signal, like the greedy squalling of a gull, but a declaration of the incipient presence of mind, that delivers us into the human realm. Before, there was only an organ of energy, intake, and excretion, but now a person has begun. And in no idle, ordinary, or jesting sense, words are what that being will become. It is language which most shows a man, Ben Jonson said: “Speake that I may see thee.” And Emerson certainly supports him: “Man is only half himself,” he said, “the other half is his expression.” Truths like this have been the long companions of our life, and so we often overlook them, as we miss the familiar mole upon our chin, even while powdering the blemish, or running over it with a razor. Silence is the soul’s invisibility. We can, of course, conceal ourselves behind lies and sophistries, but when we speak, we are present, however careful our disguise. The monster we choose to be on Halloween says something about the monster we are. I have often gone to masquerades as myself, and in that guise no one knew I was there. Plato thought of the soul as an ardent debating society in which our various interests pled their causes; and there were honest speeches and dishonest ones; there was reason, lucid and open and lovely like the nakedness of the gods, “where truth found its youngest friend and nobility its ancient eloquence; and there was also pin-eyed fanaticism, deceit and meanness, a coarseness like sand in cold grease; there was bribery and seduction, flattery, brow-beating and bombast. Little has changed, in that regard, either in our souls or in society since; for the great Greeks were correct: life must be lived according to the right word–the logos they loved–and so the search for it, the mastery of it, the fullest and finest and truest expression of it, the defense of it, became the heart of the educational enterprise. To an almost measureless degree, to know is to possess words, and all of us know how much words concern us here, at the university, in this context of texts. Adam created the animals and birds by naming them, and we name incessantly, conserving achievements and customs, and countries that no longer exist, in the museum of human memory. But it is not only the books which we pile about us like a building, or the papers we painfully compose, the exams we write, the calculations we come to by means of mystic diagrams, mathematical symbols, astrological charts or other ill- or well-drawn maps of the mind; it is not alone the languages we learn to mispronounce, the lists, the arguments and rhymes, we get by heart; it is not even our tendency to turn what is unwritten into writing with a mere look, so that rocks will suddenly say their age and origin and activity, or what is numb flesh and exposed bone will cry out that cotton candy killed it, or cancer, or canoodling, the letter C like a cut across an artery, the flow of meaning like blood; no, it is not the undeniable importance of these things which leads me to lay such weight upon the word; it is rather our interior self I’m concerned with, and therefore with the language which springs out of the most retiring and inmost parts of us, and is the image of its parent like a child: the words we use to convey our love to another, or to cope with anxiety, for instance; the words which will convince, persuade, which will show us clearly, or make the many one; the words I listen to when I wait out a speech at a dinner party; words which can comfort and assuage, damage and delight, amuse and dismay; but above all, the words which one burns like beacons against the darkness, and which together comprise the society of the silently speaking self; because all these words are but humble echoes of the words the poet uses when she speaks of passion, or the historian when he drives his nails through time, or when the psychoanalyst divines our desires as through tea leaves left at the bottom of our dreams. Even if the world becomes so visual that words must grow faces to save themselves, and put on smiles made of fragrant paste, and even if we all hunker down in front of films like savages before a divinity, have experience explained to us in terms of experiences which need to be explained, still, we shall not trade portraits of our love affairs, only of ourselves; there is no Polaroid that will develop in moments the state of our soul, or cassette to record our pangs of conscience; so we shall never talk in doodles over dinner, or call up our spirit to its struggle with a little private sit-com or a dreary soap. Even if the world falls silent and we shrink in fear within ourselves; even if words are banished to the Balkans or otherwise driven altogether out of hearing, as though every syllable were subversive (as indeed each is); all the same, when we have withdrawn from any companionship with things and people, when we have collapsed in terror behind our talcumed skins, and we peer suspiciously through the keyholes of our eyes, when we have reached the limit of our dwindle – the last dry seed of the self – then we shall see how greatly correct is the work of Samuel Beckett, because we shall find there, inside that seed, nothing but his featureless cell, nothing but voice, nothing but darkness and talk. How desperately, then, we need to learn it – to talk to ourselves – because we are babies about it. Oh, we have excellent languages for the secrets of nature. Wave packets, black holes, and skeins of genes: we can write precisely and consequentially of these, as well as other extraordinary phenomena; but can we talk even of trifles: for instance, of the way a look sometimes crosses a face like the leap of a frog, so little does it live there, or how the habit of anger raisins the heart, or wet leaves paper a street? Our anatomy texts can skin us without our pain, the cellular urges of trees are no surprise, the skies are driven by winds we cannot see; yet science has passed daily life by like the last bus, and left it to poetry. It is terribly important to know how a breast is made: how to touch it to make a tingle, or discover a hidden cyst (we find these things written of in books); but isn’t it just as important to be able to put the beauty of a body in words, words we give like a gift to its bearer; to communicate the self to another, and in that way form a community of feeling, of thought about feeling, of belief about thought: an exchange of warmth like breathing, of simple tastes and the touch of the eye, and other sensations shortly to be sought, since there is no place for the utopia of the flesh outside the utopia of talk. It can’t be helped. We are made of layers of language like a Viennese torte. We are a Freudian dessert. My dinner companion, the lady who lent me her smile, has raised her goblet in a quiet toast. It is as though its rim had touched me, and I try to find words for the feeling, and for the wine which glows like molten rubies in her glass; because if I can do that, I can take away more than a memory which will fade faster than a winter footprint; I can take away an intense and interpreted description, a record as tough to erase as a relief, since without words what can be well and richly remembered? Yesterdays are gone like drying mist. Without our histories, without the conservation which concepts nearly alone make possible, we could not preserve our lives as were the bodies of the pharaohs, the present would soon be as clear of the past as a bright day, and we would be innocent arboreals again. Of course we could redream the occasion, or pretend to film our feeling, but we’ll need words to label and index our images anyway, and can the photograph contain the rush of color to my face, the warmth which reminds me I also am a glass and have become wine? I remember because I talk. I talk from morning to night, and then I talk on in my sleep. Our talk is so precious to us, we think we punish others when we stop. So I stay at peace because I talk. Tete-a-tetes are talk. Shop is talk. Parties are parades of anecdotes, gossip, opinion, raillery, and reportage. There is sometimes a band and we have to shout. Out of an incredibly complex gabble, how wonderfully clever of me to hear so immediately my own name; yet at my quiet breakfast table, I may be unwilling, and thus unable, to hear a thing my wife says. When wives complain that romance has fled from their marriage, they mean their husbands have grown quiet and unresponsive as moss. Taciturnity – long, lovely word – it is a famous tactic. As soon as two people decide they have nothing more to talk about, everything should be talked out. Silence shields no passion. Only the mechanical flame is sputterless and silent. Like a good husband, then, I tell my wife what went on through the day – in the car, on the courts, at the office. Well, perhaps I do not tell her allthat went on, perhaps I give her a slightly sanitized account. I tell my friends how I fared in New York, and of the impatient taxi which honked me through the streets. I tell my students the substance of what they should have read. I tell my children how it used to be (it was better), and how I was a hero (of a modest sort, of course) in the Great War, moving from fact to fiction within the space of a single word. I tell my neighbors pleasant lies about the beauty of their lawns and dogs and vandalizing tykes, and in my head I tell the whole world where to get off. Those who have reputations as great conversationalists are careful never to let anyone else open a mouth. Like Napoleons, they first conquer, then rule, the entire space of speech around them. Jesus preached. Samuel Johnson bullied. Carlyle fulminated. Bucky Fuller drones. Wittgenstein thought painfully aloud. But Socrates talked … hazardously, gayly, amorously, eloquently, religiously … he talked with wit, with passion, with honesty; he asked; he answered; he considered; he debated; he entertained; he made of his mind a boulevard before there was even a France. I remember – I contain a past – partly because my friends and family allow me to repeat and polish my tales, tall as they sometimes are, like the stalk Jack climbed to encounter the giant. Shouldn’t I be able to learn from history how to chronicle my self? “Every man should be so much an artist,” again Emerson said, “that he could report in conversation what had befallen him.” Words befell Emerson often. He made speeches on occasions like this one, and until his mind changed, he always meant what he said. Frequently his mind changed before he reached any conclusion. In his head his heart turned to look about and saw the other side. Talk, of course, is not always communication. It is often just a buzz, the hum the husband makes when he’s still lit, but the station’s gone off. We can be bores as catastrophic as quakes, causing even the earth to yawn. Talk can be cruel and injurious to a degree which is frightening; the right word wrongly used can strike a man down like a club, turn a heart dark forever, freeze the feelings; nevertheless, while the thief is threatening to take our money or our life, he has yet to do either; and while Sadat and Carter and Begin talk, while talk mediates a strike, or weighs an allegation in the press or in committee, or considers a law in congress or argues a crime in court; while a spouse gripes, or the con man cons, while ideas are explained to a point beyond opacity by the prof; then it’s not yet the dreadful day of the exam, no one has lost their nest egg or filed for divorce, sentence has not been passed, the crime has not yet occurred, the walkout, or the war. It may sound like a balk, a hitch in the motion, a failure to follow through, but many things recommend talk, not least its rich and wandering rhymes. Our thoughts tend to travel like our shadow in the morning walking west, casting their outline just ahead of us so that we can see and approve, or amend and cancel, what we are about to say. It is the only rehearsal our conversation usually gets; but that is one reason we fall upon cliche as if it were a sofa and not a sword; for we have rehearsed “good morning,” and “how are you?” and “have a nice day,” to the place where the tongue is like a stale bun in the mouth; and we have talked of Tommy’s teeth and our cold car’s stalling treachery, of our slobby dog’s affection and Alice’s asthma and Hazel’s latest honeybunny, who, thank god, is only black and not gay like her last one; we have emptied our empty jars over one another like slapstick comics through so many baggy-panted performances we can now dream of Cannes and complain of Canada with the same breath we use to spit an olive in a napkin, since one can easily do several thoughtless things at once – in fact, one ought; and indeed it is true that prefab conversation frees the mind, yet rarely does the mind have a mind left after these interconnected cliches have conquered it; better to rent rooms to hooligans who will only draw on the walls and break the furniture; for our Gerberized phrases touch nothing; they keep the head hollow by crowding out thought; they fill all the chairs with buttocks like balloons; they are neither fed nor feed; they drift like dust; they refuse to breathe. We forget sometimes that we do live with ourselves – worse luck most likely – as well as within. The head we inhabit is a haunted house. Nevertheless, we often ignore our own voice when it speaks to us: “Remember me,” the spirit says, “I am your holy ghost.” But we are bored by our own baloney. Why otherwise would we fall in love if not to hear that same sweet hokum from another? Still, we should remember that we comprise true Siamese twins, fastened by language and feeling, wed better than any bed; because when we talk to ourselves we divide into the self which is all ear and the self which is all mouth. Yet which one of us is which? Does the same self do most of the talking while a second self soaks it up, or is there a real conversation? Frequently we put on plays like a producer: one voice belongs to sister, shrill and intrepidly stupid; a nephew has another (he wants a cookie); the boss is next – we’ve cast him as a barnyard bully; and then there is a servant or a spouse, crabby and recalcitrant. All speak as they are spoken through; each runs around in its role like a caged squirrel, while an audience we also invent (patient, visible, too easily pleased) applauds the heroine or the hero because of the way they’ve righted wrongs like an avenging angel, answered every challenge like a Lancelot, every question like Ann Landers, and met every opportunity like a perfect Romeo, every romance like a living doll. If we really love the little comedy we’ve constructed, it’s likely to have a long run. Does it really matter how richly and honestly and well we speak? What is our attitude toward ourselves; what tone do we tend to take? Consider Hamlet, a character who escapes his circumstances and achieves greatness despite the fact his will wavers or he can’t remember his father’s ghost. He certainly doesn’t bring it off because he has an Oedipus complex (we are all supposed to have that); but because he talks to himself more beautifully than anyone else ever has. Consider his passion, his eloquence, his style, his range: “O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!” he exclaims; “now could I drink hot blood,” he brags; “to be or not to be,” he wonders; “O,” he hopes, “that this too too solid flesh would melt,” and he complains that all occasions do inform against him. For our part, what do we do? do we lick our own hand and play the spaniel? do we whine and wheedle or natter like a ninny? Can we formulate our anger in a righteous phrase, or will we be reduced to swearing like a soldier? All of us are dramatists, but how will we receive our training? Where can we improve upon the puerile theatricals of our parents, if not here among the plays and perils of Pirandello and the dialogues of Plato (among the many glories of the letter “P” – “peachtree” and “pulchritude,” “philosophy” and “friendship”), the operas of Puccini and the follies of the faculty? If we think awareness is like water purling gaily in its stream, we have been listening to the wrong James, for our consciousness is largely composed of slogans and signs, of language of one kind or other: we wake to an alarm; we read the weather by the brightness of a streak on the ceiling, the mood of our lover by the night’s cramp still clenched in her morning body; our trembling tells us we’re hung over; we wipe ourselves with a symbol of softness, push an ad around over our face; the scale rolls up a number which means “overweight,” and the innersoles of our shoes say “hush!” Thus, even if we haven’t uttered a word, we’ve so far spent the morning reading. Signs don’t stream. They may straggle, but they mostly march. Language allies itself with order. Even its fragments suggest syntax, wholeness, regularity, though many of us are ashamed to address ourselves in complete sentences. Rhetorically structured paragraphs seem pretentious to us, as if, to gaze at our image in a mirror, we had first to put on a tux; and this means that everything of real importance, every decision which requires care, thoughtful analysis, emotional distance, and mature judgment, must be talked out with someone else – a consequence we can’t always face, with its attendant arguments, embarrassments, counterclaims, and lies. To think for yourself – not narrowly, but rather as a mind – you must be able to talk to yourself: well, openly, and at length. You must come in from the rain of requests and responses. You must take and employ your time as if it were your life. And that side of you which speaks must be prepared to say anything so long as it is so – is seen so, felt so, thought so – and that side of you which listens must be ready to hear horrors, for much of what is so is horrible – horrible to see, horrible to feel, horrible to consider. But at length, and honestly – that is not enough. To speak well to oneself … to speak well we must go down as far as the bucket can be lowered. Every thought must be thought through from its ultimate cost back to its cheap beginnings; every perception, however profound and distant, must be as clear and easy as the moon; every desire must be recognized as a relative and named as fearlessly as Satan named his angels; finally, every feeling must be felt to its bottom where the bucket rests in the silt and water rises like a tower around it. To talk to ourselves well requires, then, endless rehearsals – rehearsals in which we revise, and the revision of the inner life strikes many people as hypocritical; but to think how to express some passion properly is the only way to be possessed by it, for unformed feelings lack impact, just as unfelt ideas lose weight. So walk around unrewritten, if you like. Live on broken phrases and syllable gristle, telegraphese and film reviews. No one will suspect … until you speak. There are kinds and forms of this inner speech. Many years ago, when my eldest son was about fourteen, I was gardening alongside the house one midday in mid-May, hidden as it happened between two bushes I was pruning, when Richard came out of the house in a hurry to return to school following lunch, and like a character in a French farce, skulking there, I overheard him talking to himself. “Well, racing fans, it looks … it looks like the question we’ve all been asking is about to be answered, because HERE COMES RICHARD GASS OUT OF THE PITS NOW! He doesn’t appear to be limping from that bad crash he had at the raceway yesterday – what a crash that was! – and he is certainly going straight for his car … what courage! … yes, he is getting into his car … not a hesitation … yes, he is going to be off in a moment for the track … yes –” and then he went, peddling out of my hearing, busily broadcasting his life. My son’s consciousness, in that moment, was not only thoroughly verbal (although its subject was the Indy 500, then not too many days away, and although he could still see the street he would ride on), it had a form: that given to his language and its referents by the radio sportscaster. Richard’s body was, in effect, on the air; his mind was in the booth “upstairs,” while his feelings were doubtless mixed in with his audience, both at home and in the stands. He was being seen, and heard, and spoken of, at the same time. Later this led me to wonder whether we all didn’t have fashions and forms in which we talked to ourselves; whether some of these might be habits of the most indelible sort, the spelling out of our secret personality; and, finally, whether they might not vitally influence the way we spoke to others, especially in our less formal moments – in bed, at breakfast, at the thirteenth tee. I recognized at once that this was certainly true of me; that although I employed many modes, there was one verbal form which had me completely in its grip the way Baron Munchhausen was held in his own tall tales, or the Piers Plowman poet in his lovely alliteration. If Richard’s was that of the radio broadcast, mine was that of the lecture. I realized that when I woke in the morning, I rose from bed only to ask the world if it had any questions. I was, almost from birth, and so I suppose by “bottom nature,” what Gertrude Stein called Ezra Pound – a village explainer – which, she said, was all right if you were a village, but if not, not; and sooner than sunrise I would be launched on an unvoiced speechification on the art of internal discourse, a lecture I have given many times, though rarely aloud. I have since asked a number of people, some from very different backgrounds, what shape their internal talk took, and found, first of all, that they agreed to the important presence of these forms, and that one type did tend to dominate the others: it was often broadcasting – never the lecture – though I once encountered a sermon and several prayers; it frequently took place in the courtroom where one was conducting a fearless prosecution or a triumphant defense; it was regularly the repetition of some pattern of parental exchange, a rut full of relatives and preconditioned response; the drama appeared to be popular, as well as works of pornography, though, in this regard, there were more movies shown than words said – a pity, both modes need such improvement; monologues such as Browning might have penned: the vaunt, the threat, the keen, the kvetch, the eulogy for yourself when dead; there was even the bedtime story, the diary, the chronicle, and, of course, the novel, gothic in character, or at least full of intrigue and suspense: Little did William Gass realize when he rose that gentle May morning to thump his chest and touch his toes that he would soon be embarked on an adventure whose endless ramifications would utterly alter his life; otherwise he might not have set out for the supermarket without a list; otherwise he might not have done that extra push-up; he might better have stayed in bed with the bedclothes pulled thickly over his stupidly chattering head. Yet I should like to suggest (despite the undeniable sappiness of it) that the center of the self, itself, is this secret, obsessive, often silly, nearly continuous voice – the voice that is the surest sign we are alive; and that one fundamental function of language is the communication with this self which it makes feasible; and that, if the university has done its work, you are a bit nearer than you were before to being one of the few fortunates who have made rich and beautiful the great conversation which constitutes our life. Everywhere here in this Quad, everywhere along the long lines of listening chairs – like a choir before bursting into song – there is the silent murmur of us all, our glad, our scrappy, rude, grand, small talk to ourselves, the unheard hum of our humanity; without which – think of it! – we might not be awake; without which – imagine it! – we might not be alive; since while we speak we live up there above our bodies in the mind, and there is hope as long as we continue to talk; so long as we continue to speak, to search for eloquence even over happiness or sympathy in sorrow, even if all that is left to us is the omitted outcry, Christ’s query, the silent shout: “My God, my God, why have you left me alone?”\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"To the graduating class I address myself to, I want to say first how much I admire you – from here. And I admire you for more than I see. I admire you for having completed a four-year plan, and I admire anybody or any nation that can complete one. I never could do that. I am too impatient. If I could complete a four-year plan, I would write an epic for you. I never succeeded in writing an epic. I lose my interest. And I want to say, after praising you that way, I want to say what I expect of you. From what I know this college, what I have learned through the years and what I learned last night and this morning about you, I expect a good deal. I was relieved to hear it said in so many words that you weren’t expected to go on thinking that learning was all. Piling up knowledge is as bad as piling up money, indefinitely. You were expected at some point, or earlier – had been expected here earlier – to begin to kick around what you know. The word “freedom” is on everybody’s lips. I never have valued any liberty conferred on me particularly. I value myself on the liberties I take, and I have learned to appreciate the word “unscrupulous”. I am not a sticker at trifles. If I wrote the history of the world in jail like Nehru 20 years ago, I would expect to take many liberties with the story. I should expect to bend the story the way I wanted it to go somewhat. There’s a certain measure of unscrupulousness in it. I find the same thing in good scientists. An unscrupulous person for me in science, history or literature is a person doesn’t stick at trifles. Now the freedom that I am asked to think about sometimes is the freedom to speak, to speak out – academic and in the press, newspapers, from the platform like this. I say I have the right to tell anything, to talk about anything I am smart enough to find out about. Second, I am free to talk about anything I am deep enough to understand, and third, I am free to talk about anything I have the ability to talk about. The limitations on my freedom, you see, are more in myself than anywhere else. The ability to find out, the ability to understand, the ability to express. But now that you have had more of that freedom here – and I complement you on that – then you get in most colleges, you have reached the point of sweeping thoughts, sweeping thoughts like Toynbee’s when he writes about the history of the world – you know, he leaves Vermont out – unscrupulous! But he has his points to make, and the point is the great thing, and there is the courage. There is no time when I talk or when you talk when we ought not to introduce ourselves with the expression, “I make bold to say.” And making bold to say means leaving out what you don’t want – no lies; that is corruption. But leave out what you don’t want to say. From now on what I expect of you is more than this. Freedom has already been inculcated to help you understand freedom. But I expect more than this. I expect that you have picked up in these years of your growth and here at college – not only here at college but in the world – some interests, say four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten – I don’t know – main ones, chief ones. For instance you are probably interested in the immortality of the soul, and you are interested in this subject of corruption in our affairs, the corruption that comes a good deal from the vastness of our population. You are interested in education. Now those interests lead you not to uncertainty. I want you to treat them – I am coming to the chief one – I want you to treat them as knitting you keep to pick up at odd moments in the rest of your lives. Not just to pick up with uncertainty, but to pick up to knit, to have ideas about. Not to opinionate about, but to have ideas about. That’s something more. Let me tell you about what I mean. Opinion is just pro and con, having your nose counted. I don’t believe that women can write philosophy, and somebody says to me, “why do you believe that?” Well, I believe that if I have an idea about it; it isn’t just an opinion. I can’t leave it that way. I believe it because no woman in the whole world’s history has ever made a name for herself in philosophy. It just occurred to me the other day. I pick up the question of feminism and anti-feminism as one piece of knitting that I do something with every little while. I did a little knitting about that the other day. Now the immortality of the soul, for instance. I pick up that one every so often. Is there a hereafter? Am I thinking about a hereafter? Is a hereafter more to me than the present? And so on. Am I so interested in the hereafter that I have no interest in any reform that is going on education? You, of course, would first prefer to think, to have the idea yourselves. I judge that from the kind of education you had. I myself would. I am very selfish that way. I would rather think, have an idea myself, than have an idea given to me. Second to my selfishness there is an unselfishness I sometimes have, so I’ll pay attention to what somebody else says to me, as you are asked to listen to me now. But the main thing is to think of it first myself. Now there is a word we’ve had that goes wrong. I don’t know whether you have encountered it or not. The word is, “the dream”. I wonder how much you have encountered it? I have it thrown in my face every little while, and always by somebody who thinks the dream has not yet come true. And then the next time I pick it up to knit, I wonder what the dream is, or why. And the next time I pick it up, I wonder who dreamed it. Did Tom Paine dream it, did Thomas Jefferson dream it, did George Washington dream it? Gouverneur Morris? And lately I’ve decided the best dreamer of it was Madison. I have been reading the Federalist papers. But anyway I’m always concerned with the question, it is a dream that’s gone by? Each age is a dream that is dying they say, or one that is coming to birth. It depends on what you mean by an age. Is the age over in which that dream had its existence – has it gone by? Can we treat the Constitution as if it were something gone by? Can we interpret it out of existence? By calling it a living document, it means something different every day, something new every day, until it doesn’t mean anything that it meant to Madison. And this thought occurred to me the other day when I picked it up. Has the dream, instead of having come true, has it done something that the witches talk about? Has it simply materialized? Young writers that I know, novelists that I know, began as poets, most of them. They began more ethereal than substantial, and have ended up more substantial than ethereal. And is that what has happened to our country – has the ethereal idealism of the founders materialized into something too material? In South America this last year at a convention I heard everybody regretting, or fearing or worrying about our materialism. Not for our own sake, but for their sake, because we were misleading them into a material future for the whole world, and anxiety for us. I told him we were anxious about that too. We have scales in our bathrooms to see how material we are getting. Now I think what I want to say to you is – the first thing is that women have not been philosophers. They have been too wise to be philosophers. They have the wisdom of all such sayings as, “misery loves company” or “we all must eat our peck of dirt.” That is just a figurative way of saying we must all be a little – but I won’t say that. Or else, in California I learned to say we all must eat our pack of gold. That means we all must get a little rich…the country must get rich, and we must not fear that. Now I know – I think I know, as of today – what Madison’s dream was. It was just a dream of a new land to fulfill with people in self-control. In self-control. That is all through his thinking. And let me say that again to you. To fulfill this land – a new land – with people in self-control. And do I think that dream has failed? Has come to nothing, or has materialized too much? It is always the fear. We live in constant fear, of course. To cross the road, we live in fear of cars. But we can live in fear if we want to of too much education, too little education, too much of this, too little of that. But the thing is, the measure. I am always relieved when I am introduced, when something has happened before me when I see someone making motions like this [gesture of conducting a chorus] like a metronome. Seeing the music measured. Measure always reassures me. Measure in love, in government, measure in selfishness, measure in unselfishness. Measure in selfishness. My selfishness is in being the one to think of it first, and is only just a little ahead of my unselfishness in listening to someone else who thinks of it ahead of me. But first comes the selfishness of being the one to think of it, and to take the liberty. Now I thought I would say a poem to you, a poem about what Madison may have thought. This is called, “The Gift Outright” and it is my story of the Revolutionary war. My story of the Revolutionary war might be about two little battles. One little battle called King’s Mountain and another little battle called Bennington – but I’ll leave battles out and give you the abstract. The Gift Outright The land was ours before we were the land’s. She was our land more than a hundred years Before we were her people. She was ours In Massachusetts, in Virginia, But we were England’s, still colonials, Possessing what we still were unpossessed by, Possessed by what we now no more possessed. Something we were withholding made us weak Until we found out that it was ourselves We were withholding from our land of living, And forthwith found salvation in surrender. Such as we were we gave ourselves outright (The deed of gift was many deeds of war) To the land vaguely realizing westward, But still unstoried, artless, unenhanced, Such as she was, such as she would become. …the dream was to occupy the land with character – that’s another way to put it – to occupy a new land with characte You must have these interests that you keep to knit. And you must not live in uncertainly about anything like that – just with no ideas at all about them. That’s what I call to be a Dover beach-comber – to wish the long uncertainty would end. It isn’t that uncertainty; it’s getting forward. Every time you have a fresh idea in the knitting, that knits; it’s strengthening. It is life. It is courage. And just to get away from all that, I am going to say a poem called “Birches” – for whatever it means. I interpreted the other one, but this goes uninterpreted. Birches When I see birches bend to left and right Across the lines of straighter darker trees, I like to think some boy’s been swinging them. But swinging doesn’t bend them down to stay As ice-storms do. Often you must have seen them Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning After a rain. They click upon themselves As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel. Soon the sun’s warmth makes them shed crystal shells Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust— Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away You’d think the inner dome of heaven had fallen. They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load, And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed So low for long, they never right themselves: You may see their trunks arching in the woods Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair Before them over their heads to dry in the sun. But I was going to say when Truth broke in With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm I should prefer to have some boy bend them As he went out and in to fetch the cows— Some boy too far from town to learn baseball, Whose only play was what he found himself, Summer or winter, and could play alone. One by one he subdued his father’s trees By riding them down over and over again Until he took the stiffness out of them, And not one but hung limp, not one was left For him to conquer. He learned all there was To learn about not launching out too soon And so not carrying the tree away Clear to the ground. He always kept his poise To the top branches, climbing carefully With the same pains you use to fill a cup Up to the brim, and even above the brim. Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish, Kicking his way down through the air to the ground. So was I once myself a swinger of birches. And so I dream of going back to be. It’s when I’m weary of considerations, And life is too much like a pathless wood Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs Broken across it, and one eye is weeping From a twig’s having lashed across it open. I’d like to get away from earth awhile And then come back to it and begin over. May no fate willfully misunderstand me And half grant what I wish and snatch me away Not to return. Earth’s the right place for love: I don’t know where it’s likely to go better. I’d like to go by climbing a birch tree, And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk Toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more, But dipped its top and set me down again. That would be good both going and coming back. One could do worse than be a swinger of birches. …and that is not an escape poem, that is a retreat poem.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"Mr. President, Dr. Conant, members of the Board of Overseers, Ladies and Gentlemen: I’m profoundly grateful and touched by the great distinction and honor and great compliment accorded me by the authorities of Harvard this morning. I’m overwhelmed, as a matter of fact, and I’m rather fearful of my inability to maintain such a high rating as you’ve been generous enough to accord to me. In these historic and lovely surroundings, this perfect day, and this very wonderful assembly, it is a tremendously impressive thing to an individual in my position. But to speak more seriously, I need not tell you the world situation is very serious. That must be apparent to all intelligent people. I think one difficulty is that the problem is one of such enormous complexity that the very mass of facts presented to the public by press and radio make it exceedingly difficult for the man in the street to reach a clear appraisement of the situation. Furthermore, the people of this country are distant from the troubled areas of the earth and it is hard for them to comprehend the plight and consequent reactions of the long-suffering peoples of Europe, and the effect of those reactions on their governments in connection with our efforts to promote peace in the world. In considering the requirements for the rehabilitation of Europe, the physical loss of life, the visible destruction of cities, factories, mines and railroads was correctly estimated, but it has become obvious during recent months that this visible destruction was probably less serious than the dislocation of the entire fabric of European economy. For the past ten years conditions have been abnormal. The feverish preparation for war and the more feverish maintenance of the war effort engulfed all aspects of national economies. Machinery has fallen into disrepair or is entirely obsolete. Under the arbitrary and destructive Nazi rule, virtually every possible enterprise was geared into the German war machine. Long-standing commercial ties, private institutions, banks, insurance companies, and shipping companies disappeared through loss of capital, absorption through nationalization, or by simple destruction. In many countries, confidence in the local currency has been severely shaken. The breakdown of the business structure of Europe during the war was complete. Recovery has been seriously retarded by the fact that two years after the close of hostilities a peace settlement with Germany and Austria has not been agreed upon. But even given a more prompt solution of these difficult problems, the rehabilitation of the economic structure of Europe quite evidently will require a much longer time and greater effort than had been foreseen. There is a phase of this matter which is both interesting and serious. The farmer has always produced the foodstuffs to exchange with the city dweller for the other necessities of life. This division of labor is the basis of modern civilization. At the present time it is threatened with breakdown. The town and city industries are not producing adequate goods to exchange with the food-producing farmer. Raw materials and fuel are in short supply. Machinery is lacking or worn out. The farmer or the peasant cannot find the goods for sale which he desires to purchase. So the sale of his farm produce for money, which he cannot use, seems to him an unprofitable transaction. He, therefore, has withdrawn many fields from crop cultivation and is using them for grazing. He feeds more grain to stock and finds for himself and his family an ample supply of food, however short he may be on clothing and the other ordinary gadgets of civilization. Meanwhile, people in the cities are short of food and fuel, and in some places approaching the starvation levels. So the governments are forced to use their foreign money and credits to procure these necessities abroad. This process exhausts funds which are urgently needed for reconstruction. Thus a very serious situation is rapidly developing which bodes no good for the world. The modern system of the division of labor upon which the exchange of products is based is in danger of breaking down. The truth of the matter is that Europe’s requirements for the next three or four years of foreign food and other essential products - principally from America - are so much greater than her present ability to pay that she must have substantial additional help or face economic, social and political deterioration of a very grave character. The remedy seems to lie in breaking the vicious circle and restoring the confidence of the European people in the economic future of their own countries and of Europe as a whole. The manufacturer and the farmer throughout wide areas must be able and willing to exchange their product for currencies, the continuing value of which is not open to question. Aside from the demoralizing effect on the world at large and the possibilities of disturbances arising as a result of the desperation of the people concerned, the consequences to the economy of the United States should be apparent to all. It is logical that the United States should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health in the world, without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace. Our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine but against hunger, poverty, desperation, and chaos. Its purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to permit the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist. Such assistance, I am convinced, must not be on a piecemeal basis as various crises develop. Any assistance that this Government may render in the future should provide a cure rather than a mere palliative. Any government that is willing to assist in the task of recovery will find full cooperation, I am sure, on the part of the United States Government. Any government which maneuvers to block the recovery of other countries cannot expect help from us (applause). Furthermore, governments, political parties, or groups which seek to perpetuate human misery in order to profit therefrom politically or otherwise will encounter the oppositions of the United States (applause). It is already evident that, before the United States government can proceed much further in its efforts to alleviate the situation and help start the European world on its way to recovery, there must be some agreement among the countries of Europe as to the requirements of the situation and the part those countries themselves will take in order to give proper effect to whatever action might be undertaken by this government. It would be neither fitting nor efficacious for our government to undertake to draw up unilaterally a program designed to place Europe on its feet economically. This is the business of the Europeans. The initiative, I think, must come from Europe. The role of this country should consist of friendly aid in the drafting of the European program and of later support of such a program so far as it may be practical for us to do so. The program should be a joint one, agreed to by a number, if not all, European nations. An essential part of any successful action on the part of the United States is an understanding on the part of the people of America of the character of the problem and the remedies to be applied. Political passion and prejudice should have no part. With foresight, and a willingness on the part of our people to face up to the vast responsibility which history has clearly placed upon our country, the difficulties I have outlined can and will be overcome (applause). I am sorry that on each occasion I have said something publicly in regard to our international situation, I’ve been forced by the necessities of the case to enter into rather technical discussions. But to my mind, it is of vast importance that our people reach some general understanding of what the complications really are, rather than react from a passion or a prejudice or an emotion of the moment. As I said more formally a moment ago, we are remote from the scene of these troubles. It is virtually impossible at this distance merely by reading, or listening, or even seeing photographs and motion pictures, to grasp at all the real significance of the situation. And yet the whole world of the future hangs on a proper judgment. It hangs, I think, to a large extent on the realization of the American people, of just what are the various dominant factors. What are the reactions of the people? What are the justifications of those reactions? What are the sufferings? What is needed? What can best be done? What must be done? Thank you very much.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"About all that a commencement orator can do for his auditors is to turn their faces around. He looks back upon the world as he thinks it was. Then he considers the world as he thinks it is. Finally in his receding perspective he discloses the pictured phantasm which he hopes will be the future. Thereupon his young listeners may see mirrored in the gloss of his picture the world which they think they will make. It is a pleasant exercise. This commencement oratory which floods our land every June may be an effective anesthetic which youth may take at its second birth, out of the solid, unyielding, factual environment of childhood and of books, out of the substantial fabric of the curriculum with its sure reward of grade, class standing, and satisfying compensation into the bewildering, hazy, and altogether ironic mockeries that we call, in humorous euphony, real life. I stand here tiptoeing near the end of my three score years and ten. There you sit across an abysm scarcely fifty feet wide but deeper than the distance to the moon. I come out of one dream world that is memory. You go into a visionary world that is hope. I tell you of the things that I imagine are true in my world. You hold in your hearts the picture of your world that shall be. We dwell on these two different planets. How can I hope to get across the chasm of time and space any hint, even a flickering shadow of my truth that will reach your hearts? For my world seemed to be a static world when I stood fifty years ago where you stand now. My forebears since Caesar’s day had not greatly changed the tools with which they made their clothes, got their goods, built their houses; nor had they changed greatly in those twenty centuries the philosophy upon which they erected their future. Today you look back upon a world that has moved so far in one hundred years that nothing you see and feel, touch and taste, hope, believe, and love is as it was when your grandfathers learned from their grandfathers how to live in another day. So what may have some bearing, though heaven only knows what, upon you lives. Perhaps I can tell you something, and being called here, I shall try… We know we have not done God’s work perfectly. The world we have made out of the inheritance of our grandfathers is a pretty sad botch. It is full of gross injustices. Obviously a couple of centuries of hard work needs to be done on it before America is turned out, finished in its millennial beauty. But with all these inequities, the old thing does hold together. We turn our country over to you in one piece - which is something. Even if it isn’t a pretty piece, it is yours, with its spiritual hereditaments. And may I be pardoned the vanity of one who worked on the job if I try to give you some idea of what has held this nation in unity during a century and a half when in many other parts of the globe races and tongues and economic units have been breaking into small states, magnifying nationalism into a vice. Today, as never before, nationalism in small geographical areas is pulling men into bitter disunion and controversy. Some flame of envy and rancor is abroad in the world. We see it moving across the face of Europe in various tyrannies, each exalting its own nationalism, each challenging liberty in its own way - Italy under fascism, Germany under the Nazis, Russia under communism, Spain boiling with confusion, while the two principles of dictatorship, that of the plutocracy and that of the proletariat, struggle for possession of that brave land. These isms are types of one pestilence which is threatening civilization. That this spiritual pestilence will attack America, no one can doubt. How can we Americans immunize ourselves? The class of ‘37 must find out why small geographical, social racial units are erupting into a virulent nationalism that threatens western civilization. It’s your problem, esteemed descendants, but here’s a hint that might help you to solve it. I am satisfied that the disease has its root in a lack of social faith. The thing that has bound America into one nation is tolerance - tolerance and patience; indeed, tolerance and patience upheld by a sense of duty. At this point, dearly beloved members of the class of ‘37, I propose to reveal the screw loose in my mental processes, also to show you something of the aberration of your forebears. You have this dementia in you blood, and you might as well know it. Your fathers, mothers, and remote ancestors for several thousand years believed in the reality of duty. Upon that madness they built the world. Not that I wish to brag about it - this sense of duty - but I still hug the delirium of my generation to my heart and believe there is something in those old-fashioned eccentricities known as the Christian virtues. Don’t get excited. I am not preaching piety. I have no plan of salvation to offer you, no theology to defend. But I feel, and my generation has believed in a general way, that democracy with its freedom, with its patience, with its tolerance, with its altruism, is a sort of rough attempt to institutionalize the Christian philosophy. And when I say rough, I mean rough, something like a 20 percent realization of a noble ideal. Our American Constitution, for instance, is a national compact of our individual and of our social duties. It has worked in this country after a fashion. Yet the same Constitution, or nearly the same, has been adopted in a dozen other lands and has failed. Why has it held us to an essential unity? I am satisfied that our Constitution has stood up because Americans actually have established here a sort of code of duties. That has been the crystallizing principle that has held us together - duty of man to man, of region to region, of class to class, of race to race, of faith to faith. That duty has bred something more than neighborly tolerance. It has engendered a profound desire in very American’s heart to make life as pleasant as it may be made - not merely for himself, indeed not chiefly for himself, but for others. Thus we have found and cherished true liberty. Liberty if it shall cement man into political unity, must be something more than a man’s conception of his rights, much more than his desire to fight for his own rights. True liberty is founded upon a lively sense of the rights of others and a fighting conviction that the rights of others must be maintained. Only when a people have this love of liberty, this militant belief in the sacredness of another man’s self respect, do races and nations posses the catalyzer in their political and social organism which produces the chemical miracle of crystallized national unity and strength. We Americans have had it for three hundred years on this continent. It was in the blood of our fathers. It was the basis of our faith in humanity when we wrote our Constitution. It has been with us a long time on this continent - this capacity for compromise, this practical passion for social justice and for altruistic equity in settling the genuine differences of men. This high quality of mutual respect is no slight gift. It is a heroic spiritual endowment, this knack of getting along together on a continental scale. We have set as a national custom the habit of majority rule. This custom is maintained not by arms but by a saving sense in the heart of every minority that any majority will not be puffed up, will not infringe upon the rights of the minority. Matching this duty of the majority to be fair, we have set up the component duty of the minority to be patient, but to agitate until the justice of a losing cause has convinced the winning majority. This American tradition of political adjustment cuts through every line of cleavage and all difference in our social organization - regions, classes, races, creed. Here is the way it has worked. As our country has expanded geographically, this political genius for unity has tapped our store of certain basic virtues: neighborly forbearance, meekness, unselfishness, and that belief in the essential decency of don’ts, neighbors which, for want of a better word, we have called love. Now, in our land abideth these three: faith in our fellows, hope in the triumph of reason, and love for humanity. With all the grievous faults and glaring weaknesses of our federal union, these things are the centripetal spiritual forces which have solidified America. These commonsense qualities which have grown out of the Beatitudes have helped to preserve the American Union for the last century and a half. Now what are you going to do about it, you who stand here at the threshold of the reality of your past, looking into the evanescent horizon of your future? We who shall soon be petrified into pedestaled ghosts as your ancestors have a notion that you, our descendants, don’t have much use for duty, for patience, and for tolerance. We get the general idea that you have no sort of faith in the strength of the humble. Yet it is out of this lack of faith that a new challenge has appeared in the world, a challenge aimed at democracy, a challenge which scorns these lowly neighborly virtues that have held our world together. This challenge is finding its way into our American life. We are being told that the majority sometimes has emergency mandates to ignore the rights of the minorities. We have set up rulers all over earth who preach against the virtue of patience. It is a new thing in our America to hear men defending the tyrannies of Europe - communism, fascism, and the Nazis - declaring that the minority is right. It is even a stranger doctrine in America, which holds that a passing majority, by reason of its being a ballot box majority at one or two elections, has an inherent right immediately to suppress and ruthlessly destroy an honest minority. Now, as an ancestor, let me caution you, my heirs and assigns, that these new political attitudes are symptoms of greed for power. They will fool you if you channel your thinking into narrow dialectics. Don’t take your logical premise from your class self-interest. Don’t build your logic upon a purely selfish structure. Don’t think as plutocrats. Don’t reason as members of the middle class or as proletarians. Such thinking is too sure of its own syllogisms ever to be just. Such thinking rejects the possibility that there is truth and that there may be reason in the contention of another class of society. This same discord that has torn as under so many peoples in Europe, where fifty years ago democracy seemed to be taking root, today is seeding in our land. Capitalists are scoring labor leaders. Labor leaders are preaching distrust and hatred for capitalists. The revelations of the La Follette committee in the United States Senate now investigating the infringement of civil liberties certainly lay bare the cancer of hatred in our economic body that is poisoning our national blood. The class-conscious arrogance of wealth is creating its own class morals. Proletarian logic is justifying the use of force in class conflict and condoning cunning. The industrial enterpriser shuts his eyes to the tragedy of the farmer’s economic plight. Then the farmer envies the financier. But I feel sure the tide will turn. You who stand here, chisel in hand, about to hew out the future, have something in you; humanity’s most precious mental gift - the eternal resilience, the everlasting bounce in man. You may love for the moment the indolent sense of futility that comes with the grand cynicism of youth. But life, experience, the hazards of your day, and time will bring out of you the courage bred into you. You will find that you have the urge that we had. You will want to believe in something in spite of yourselves. You will want to construct something. For you are the sons and daughters of a creative people, inventive, resourceful, daring. And above all, in spite of the many unpleasant things you have learned in this cloister, in spite of the hard realties that have molded your youth, you are mystics, you are crusaders, you are incorrigible visionaries in the noblest sense of these words. The eternal verities of your inheritance, the organizing brains, the industry, the noble purpose that during the nineteenth century made America a kindlier and more beautiful land than ever before was brought forth on this planet, will be beckoning you, urging you, indeed, sternly commanding you to follow whatever is fine and just in the achievement of your country. The residuum of what I am trying to say is this: You must reorganize life in your America and point your achievement toward a fairer distributive system. Abundance is here for the taking. don’t bemoan your lost frontier. It is even now flashing on our horizon. A gorgeous land lies before you fair and more beautiful than man before has ever known. Out of the laboratory will come new processes to multiply material things for your America, to multiply them almost infinitely; but only if you will hold open the channels of free science, unfettered thought, and the right of a man to use his talents to the utmost provided he gives honest social returns for the rewards he takes. Don’t delude yourselves about your new frontier. For on that frontier which will rise over the laboratories you will find the same struggle, the same hardships, the same inequities that your forefathers have found on every frontier since the beginning of time. You will find rapacious men trying to grab more than their share of the common bounties of the new frontier. You will find human greeds and human perfidies there as we found them fifty years ago and as our fathers found them generations upon generations before. Energetic buccaneers always thrive wherever men are pioneering. In every one of the ten long generations during which your ancestors have been conquering this continent and building a proud civilization here, they have struggled as you will struggle against the injustices of life which are bred out of the lust for power in unsocial men. But don’t let that discourage you… And now, in closing, on behalf of your fathers who are bequeathing to you their choicest gifts, let me say that your heritage is not in these great lovely cities, not this wide and fertile land, not the mountains full of undreamed of riches. These you may find in other continents. What we leave you that is precious are the few simple virtues which have stood us in good stead in the struggle of our generation. We will and bequeath to you our enthusiasm, our diligence, our zeal for a better world, that were the lode stars of our fathers. As our legatees we assign you our tolerance, our patience, our kindness, our faith, hope, and love, which make for the self-respect of man. These qualities of heart and mind grow out of a conviction that the democratic philosophy as mode of thinking will lead mankind into a nobler way of life.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"I'm very excited right now to be here. It's kind of like a completion of a circle in my life because Boston is my hometown. Actually, when I went out on the road from Boston I left after high school in 1960, and I've been traveling constantly since then. So I kind of lost touch with Boston for awhile. And recently I've been coming back and touching my roots again. Being invited here by Berklee completes my reestablishing my touch with Boston. I'm very happy about that, and that Berklee becomes a focal point of creativity here in town. I'm very happy to finally accept [Berklee's invitation] to come here and be here with you all. My mother...my uncles aunts and cousins are here—so we've all come here to congratulate you. All of us—the whole Corea clan. This is a very unusual thing for me to do—to express my sentiments in words and just speak to you...but I do have a couple of sentiments, so I'm going to make an attempt to express them. How much time do I have? (Looks at Vice President Gary Burton, chuckles.) Just kidding. One of my overall sentiments is the sentiment of congratulations and, really, acknowledgment for the accomplishments. Accomplishments, to me, are on a lot of different levels. The ones that I really want to acknowledge in you all are the ones that mainly that you know that you've achieved. The thing that binds us all together here, I think, is that we all love to put creativity and music into the world and brighten each other up, and brighten the environment up with what we do. And basically, I think if we surveyed each other, we'd probably word it differently, but we'd come up with a similar reason why we all got into it in the first place. Like, Why did you become a musician? Why do you want to pursue the life of art? What's the attraction? I'll betcha that we'll all come up with very similar answers, very simple ones, that maybe sometimes you don't state because they seem inconsequential. But I don't think they are. It's a desire that we have, one way or another. Something that we saw at one point in life attracted us to pursue the life of creating music. We started to do [create] it, and it was fun, and joyous, and brought wonderful feelings all around us and we just kept going. Now every time you make a step toward that—by practicing, performing, and finally accomplishing one little thing that you wanted to accomplish—whatever the success is in your minds, you build on it. That's what I want to congratulate you all on, and the college on, and all of us on—in pursuing that intent of putting beauty out into the environment, which I think, is the thing that gives all of us incredible pleasure. So congratulations. Now that I've congratulated everybody, I have one other sentiment that I'd like to share with you. I think that one of the things we probably could agree upon is that advice is cheap. So I'm going to give you some cheap advice. I selected one piece out of the sea of advice, that I thought was a pretty cool piece of advice. There's knowledge and there's second-hand knowledge, I think. What you gain, when you make an accomplishment—and you know what you can do musically, and it comes out in an action—that's knowledge that's yours, that you can build upon, and that's what you build your skills and confidence on. Only you know that. So this other thing that we all call knowledge, which comes in the form of—books, study, me yacking at you today—whatever comes at you through the newspapers and media, data and opinions, it's all data. You could call it knowledge, but the real trick, is your own selection of what you consider important and what you like to try out and test. So you take the piece of knowledge, or whatever it is, and you test it out. If it works for you—if it gets you grooving—if it gets you toward that thing you want to accomplish, then you know that it's a valuable piece of knowledge for you. So, my piece of cheap advice is that the most valuable quality that we all have is the quality of freedom of choice—the idea that out of all of the sea of information that comes toward you, there you are, and you really do have the freedom to choose what you want to do and what you think about what's coming your way. What kind of music you want to play, who you want to associate with, what things you do and don't want to do, down to every little choice you make when you're writing your music and acquiring your skills—you discard that piece, and keep this piece—I just want to remind you that you've got it [the freedom to choose]. It's a freedom we all have, and it's something I feel should be incredibly cherished and understood and valued. There's this subject that's developed in the past hundred years or so called human rights. We have the Bill of Rights. We try to state what our natural rights are. Over and over again, no matter how it's stated, it comes down to, We want to keep this freedom to decide what we like, what our tastes are, and apply them to our lives. So, that's my little bit of cheap advice. I don't know if I'm getting my point across, or stating it the way that I feel it, but, there you have it. I think you should cherish that freedom, and go out into life and really accomplish everything that you want to accomplish There's one other thing. I want to promote the idea of being and artist, and being a musician, because I know you can come through school and gather up a bit of this and that, and [make it through] an incredible bit of training, and developing your skills. But I can tell you from the viewpoint of having been out on the road for a lot of years now, playing music, that being involved in the arts, being a musician, playing for people, is a very, very fulfilling life. It really is kind of a magical life, because we live on a planet that's not really conducive to what we do. It's not easy to go out and just be creative...you have to survive. You have to make money, you have to keep the body healthy—you have to do all these various things. The planet is not, to put it mildly, at peace with itself, so we live in an environment that's kind of shaky. But as artists, and musicians, we've sort of played a trick on the rest of the world. The rest of the world wants everybody to conform to the beat, to be a nine-to-fiver, to get up and do your job and not get too excited about anything, and just agree with everything that's going on. But in music and art, there's this little window that we've got that the whole planet agrees upon is a cool thing to do. It's all right to make music. It's all right to be yourself. In fact, the more yourself you are, the more money you make, I think, anyway. [Students applaud.] So you see what I mean? We're in this little niche that is a really cool niche to be in...I want to encourage you to really go for it and do it, and accomplish it. Don't buy these opinions of, Oh it's really hard, really difficult, man. I can't find anyone to play with and nobody's into my thing, and it's hard to get a gig, and this and that—just throw all that out the window. All that is no good. So I'm trying to give you this picture of the fact that we really have rigged it so that in music and the arts the whole planet agrees that it's okay to create. Isn't that wild? I'm continually amazed...Gary [Burton, VP. of Berklee/jazz vibraphonist] and I went to Switzerland the other night and played a couple of concerts. I was just thinking about the concerts. We'd walk out into the hall and we'd play this wild music, and have an absolute blast for two hours, and people loved it. They sit there and applaud, and take it in, and smile...and then we get paid. We actually get money for it. And it's amazing. There's this agreement—the human race needs to be uplifted...it can't exist without it [being uplifted]. We'd lose ourselves...become robots. So, I see it that it's our job, in a sense, to keep on reminding people of this creative nature that everyone's got. Not just us [artists]. All human beings are innately creative. So when we play, they wake up, and it's inspiring. It takes their mind off of troubles and war and when we put each other in a state like that, we're more able to enjoy life, to do something creative, to make a right decision and do right things. So...you've chosen probably the only thing on the planet that you can do where you have the agreement to be yourself and do your thing and be creative. You're encouraged to be creative. You have to be creative. You have to be yourself. [Sarcastically] What a terrible thing to be. I encourage you to carry it the whole way. Don't get stopped by barriers and the kind of [talk] that makes it seem like it's going to be difficult [to be a musician]. I believe that you can accomplish what you want if you just continue to do it. So that's my cheap advice. I'm again very pleased to be amongst you all, I feel we're friends in music. We're doing the same thing. The school is here as a focal point to bring us all together, to bring young people to a place to learn techniques and share ideas, and it's really great. So, class of 1997, go out and kill. Thank you very much.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"When I was a kid growing up in Schenectady, New York, there was one thing that drove my life – music. The first major purchase I made with my own money was not a baseball glove. It was a Bradford transistor radio. And at night, when you could get a good AM signal for miles, I would sit under my covers and listen to everything from Martha Reeves to Roy Orbison on stations like WLS in Chicago, CKLW in Detroit and WRKO right here in Boston. Somehow God punished my addiction to music by making me… a drummer. I guess you could say he also punished everyone who lived in my house. So I became addicted to the drums… Ludwig drums to be specific. Most of my friends knew the names of the lead vocalists in every band. Forget Mick Jagger, my heroes were Charlie Watts, Cozy Powell, Ginger Baker, and Aynsley Dunbar. I knew the exact kit every one of them played. I still remember the smell of a new Ludwig drum catalog. I can also remember the day when word hit the street that Bruce Gowdy, the best drummer in Schenectady, would be heading off to Berklee. Not to San Francisco, but to Boston, the Berklee with the double e. This was a very big deal. The only other person ever to make it out of Schenectady was Pat Riley. I, too, wanted to go to Berklee, but I knew I wasn't good enough. Well, a life goal finally achieved today, thanks to you! So what can I possibly say that will be of interest to this graduating class of 2000, the best of the best, the alma mater of Bruce Gowdy... not to mention Quincy Jones, Bruce Hornsby, or Donald Fagen, to name a few. Well, I know what I'm not going to say. I'm not going to tell you that you are going to be the next Quincy Jones, Bruce Hornsby or Don Fagen. I wouldn't want you to aspire to that. You shouldn't want to. They've already achieved greatness. Now it's your turn… on your terms. Whether you leave here today to become a professional musician, or whether you are pursuing the business side of the industry, or whether you are going to be a music educator, your biggest challenge is to move beyond the current gold standard. Simply put… to challenge conventional wisdom. Most people, when they leave college, are confused about what they want to do and where they want to go. I was too. All I wanted to do when I graduated was to figure out a way to combine music and television in a meaningful way. There was only one problem, there weren't any jobs like that in 1977. You see, when I was growing up, the two biggest voices in youth culture were rock 'n' roll and television. So I saw every reason in the world why the two should be somehow combined. But when I graduated every job offer I got was to join the mailroom of a big television network and learn the ropes. The way it's done -- their way. I said, no way. I ended up taking a job in the music industry so I could learn more about the business, all the while looking for a way to follow my dream. Then, about two years out of school, I saw my opportunity. Everyone said I was nuts when I quit a perfectly good job in the record business to start a cable music channel. But it meant everything to me. I was so excited, I even forgot to ask how much I was going to get paid. (Don't make that mistake.) And I wasn't the only one. Other people believed in the same dream — five to be exact. So in late 1980, the six of us joined forces to see how far we could take this idea of putting music on television. The big network broadcasters said nobody would watch music on television. They wanted no part of us. The advertisers said there wasn't enough money to go around. The established record companies — not A&M, of course — wouldn't even return our phone calls. Who needs TV, we were told, when we've got radio? The rock critics said nobody's going to watch an artist play music. And they all said – who could possibly need more than three TV channels? Well, one year later we went against conventional wisdom and launched our cable music service. We called it MTV. Today it is carried in 300 million households around the world and is the most watched network on the planet. Most of you grew up with cable TV, but in 1980 it was virtually non-existent. My generation grew up with only three television channels that dictated how we lived our lives, and we wanted more. Back then there were hundreds of magazines and radio stations catering to every possible specific taste. But with television we had to sit there on Sunday nights watching circus acts and opera singers while waiting for the Beatles to play one song on the Ed Sullivan Show. So, with the introduction of cable TV, we set out to create a network that would be the exact opposite of broadcast TV. Our notion of television was that it should not be linear, it should not be about story lines with a beginning, middle and end. It should be about mood and emotion. MTV, ESPN, CNN…they were introduced as 24-hour environments, programmed to specific tastes of viewers. MTV was about young people and creating a 24 hour-a-day place on television that was important to them. Today, when people say, I feel like watching MTV, you know exactly what they mean. Creating that network environment was our intention. And then it became our mission, driving the birth and development of other MTV Networks brands like VH1, Nickelodeon, Nick at Nite and TV Land. It's funny, I again confronted conventional wisdom just six years ago when we set out to reposition VH1 as a music brand for the post-college audience. Conventional wisdom said that people over 25 didn't care about music. Music is a teenage thing. Once they leave college, kids grow up get jobs, and stop buying music. We saw that as strange, since adults account for over 60% of all music sales. Conventional wisdom forgot that the generation that invented rock 'n' roll music grew up, and took its love and passion for music with it, and never let go. VH1 now reaches more than 70 million homes and just last year was named AdWeek's Breakout Brand of 1999. We proved that there is life after Britney Spears. Now, I know I make it sound easy. I guess that's the benefit of speaking in hindsight. But in reality, our group took a lot of risks and we made a lot of mistakes. And in the end, we had luck and timing on our side. But we had a passion and an original idea, and we never lost sight of our goals. We kept challenging ourselves, we kept challenging tradition, we kept creating TV that followed the tastes of our audience, not the status quo. And while this all sounds so rebellious, aggressively following your vision can end up being quite profitable. Today, the MTV Networks group is more profitable than ABC, CBS, NBC, the WB, Fox and UPN — combined. Not like I'm counting. I'm just making a point. But it's not just true of MTV networks. In the 60s, Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss founded an upstart label called A&M records that went up against the big corporate giants like Columbia and MGM. They sold the little boutique label just a few years ago for $300 million dollars. So here's what I learned from conventional wisdom: Conventional wisdom said we didn't need more than three television channels. Conventional wisdom said nobody would watch music on television. Conventional wisdom is the enemy to any creative business. And while I thought I was such a rebel 20 years ago, I'm now part of the establishment. Cable TV is now part of conventional wisdom. Let's look at the media environment today. You guys grew up with 36 channels, so it's no wonder that you're the ones that drove the creation of the Internet. My generation was happy with 50 channels - that was our revolution. My initial response to the Internet was, Who has the time or desire to wade through all that information? Well, just ask any six-year-old and you'll get your answer. My five-year-old son Jack runs circles around me on our computer. My greatest fear has come true. My God, I've become my parents! But, that's the beauty of our culture, especially the arts… it is always changing. It thrives on fresh ideas, on innovation. And that's what you've spent not just the last four years, but the last 21 years preparing for. Every great idea ever created flew in the face of conventional wisdom (except of course, the 8-track and that TV show about singing cops). Originality is about new ideas. The one thing that will never change is that just when you think you know it all — it will change. Just when the world thought there was nothing better than the Sony Discman, they invented this: the Rio player. No moving parts, no skipping, and it weighs less than a pair of headphones. Soon you won't even need the box. It will all be coming from satellites right into your headphones. Or your phone…or your watch. Nothing drives this theory more than music. Entire genres of music have been created against what history dictates. In the late 70s, record companies weren't exactly lining up to sign The Police. Why would they? Sting's voice was raspy — he couldn't sing. What about hip-hop in the late 80's? It was a passing fad -- not. And let's never forget the best lesson of them all…that five labels passed on The Beatles before EMI gave them a record deal. Like all invention, music is about risk. Sure there were thousands of great artists that have preceded you. So, how do you top them? Study the greats. Then take it to the next level. Keith Richards was obsessed with Chuck Berry. And the great hip-hop artists have all sampled George Clinton's music. But they didn't just copy it… They reinvented it and made it their own. Take the shot. If it doesn't work, you can always make a decent living in a cover band. I can find only one example in which conventional wisdom has been challenged for the worse. In fact, it's downright devastating. Conventional wisdom has always said that, as parents, we want to give our kids more than we had. Historically, as a nation, we have defined this to the point of being a cliché. We all had music education. I did, our parents did. Look where it took you! Turns out we were all very, very lucky, because it's not that way anymore. Over the last 20 years we've been systematically eliminating our country's public school education programs. What's even more confusing to me is that we've done this at a time when research has shown a direct connection between music education and a child's ability to learn academic subjects like math and science. At a time when we've grown the Dow over 1000 percent, America's test scores have dropped to the bottom of all industrialized nations. Listen to these facts: Kids who are involved in music programs score more than 100 points higher on the SATs than students who are not involved. Children involved with active music participation demonstrate significant improvements in their spatial abilities, which is important for success in math and science. Children involved in music programs have improved reading abilities, higher self-esteem and are less likely to be involved with gangs and drugs. Only 25% of our nation's eighth graders are able to participate in instrumental music programs. A few years ago, I had the privilege of being Principal for a Day at PS-58 in Brooklyn. I happened to walk in to a 4th grade music class and see the most beautiful sight. Every kid had an instrument! And I couldn't believe my ears. Then I looked a little closer. The instruments were held together with gaffer's tape. The teacher informed me that she had no money in the budget for music and that the program was closing down at the end of the year. In the car on the way home I remember feeling this tremendous sense of guilt. Here I was, returning to my fancy job that I love, in the industry that I love, and here were these kids that I thought were getting the same education that I had — but who were being set up to lose. That day I made an executive decision. VH1 was going to adopt PS-58. And we did. Only we couldn't stand helping only one school, so we soon adopted the whole New York City Public School System. And it wasn't long before we said, to hell with it, let's adopt the entire country. And VH1 Save the Music was born. VH1 Save the Music is my network's way of helping to improve the quality of education in our public schools. We've partnered with all sorts of organizations, like The National Association for Music Education, the National School Boards Association, The Recording Industry Association of America, and NAMM, to set up local programs to collect used instruments and donate them to the kids that need them most. Then, whatever we don't collect, we purchase with money raised nationally by our foundation. By the end of this year we will put $10 million worth of music instruments in school music programs in 40 cities, directly affecting over 200,000 kids. That's a nice beginning. But hopefully we can use our power as a television network to raise awareness about the need to put music education back in our schools. And though it makes me feel good, I want to be very clear on something. It's not about some rich corporation giving back. It's about accountability. It's about responsibility. And after all, these children are our future customers, our future employees and our future neighbors. If these real life experiences I've shared with you this morning provide you with even a grain of inspiration to follow your own dreams, then I'll feel like I've done my job. I'm living proof that a little creativity and a decent amount of self-confidence can go a long way in achieving your dreams. Add a lot more creativity and a lot more talent, and your could be Patti Austin or Herb Alpert. One last bit of advice. You are entering a high risk business. Fortunately, you are doing so at a fascinating time in history. This is a time of transition similar to the one that I experienced with the birth of cable, only so much bigger, and so much more exciting. Today's technology will change the way you make music, the way your music gets distributed, the way your music is consumed and it will even change the way you get paid. So when you leave here today, armed with arguably the best music degree in the world, the first word you will probably hear is no. Don't worry, because that is where your journey begins, and that's when the fun begins. Because through all of the ups and downs, the victories and the mistakes, there is nothing more gratifying than defying conventional wisdom and achieving success on your terms. Ask Quincy, ask Branford, ask Elton, ask Madonna, ask Herb or ask Patti… they listened politely to the establishment, then they did it their own way. It's your turn now. Take the step. Think. Observe. Ask. Experiment. Dare. Pursue. Aggravate. Surprise. Shock. Amaze. Astonish. Succeed. And, above all, do it on your own terms. I highly recommend it. Thank you.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"First of all, let me say congratulations to each and every one of you. This is a very big day. Secondly, I would like to say, rule number one: pay attention to detail. I had no idea I was supposed to give the commencement speech till I read it on the invitation. I believe Gary Burton when he says we discussed it, but I just don't remember. Having said that, I did take this role very seriously. I wondered, What is it that you want to hear today? Or better still, What do you need to hear? What would resonate with you and stay with you? So let's start with this one: Exactly how special are you? When my stepson was about eight years old he said, Mom, I must be a great swimmer. Why? Why do you say that? Well, because out of all the millions of sperm, I got there first! Think about that. Out of all the billions of combinations, you were born. Let's look a little further. Two billion people live on two dollars a day. One billion people live on less than a dollar a day. That's half of the population of the world. And that same half will never go past the sixth grade. Those same 3 billion people will never travel more than 50 miles from where they were born. Two-thirds of them will die before their 50th birthday, and almost all of them will work and toil harder than most of us here in this room. Makes you kind of wonder how important it really is when you can't find the right shirt to wear, or you're having a bad hair day. I want to talk about myself for a minute, but not all that Then I wrote this and Then I produced that crap. If I had the exact formula for winning 14 Grammys (notice how I got that in), I'm sure you would all pull out your pen and paper and listen with great interest. But I don't. It would be a very important thing that I would say. I grew up on an island in British Columbia. Like all of you, I had a great love and burning desire to make music from as far back as I can remember. I was making as much money as my father by the time I was 13. I was an average student and after the 11th grade, I quit school and moved to England to pursue my passion for music. I've never done any drugs. I don't drink. I've never been arrested. I've never been in a fight. I got along with my parents 99% of the time. I love my sisters. They love me. I love my children more than anything else in the world. I love my wife. And I love my work. I had the good fortune to find something that I was passionate about and that I was good at. I put the blinders on and from age 10 till this morning I have worked 24/7 to live my dream. I've never partied hard and I don't feel like I've missed out on a single thing. Except a college education. Not just for music, but to be a more well-rounded person. I wish I knew more about Greek mythology or Roman history or the sky above us or the oceans around us. So be open to things other than music. Remember the first words you learned in grade school: Look . . . and . . . listen. God gave you two ears, two eyes, but only one mouth. So look and listen twice as much as you speak. Learn as much as you can about everything. Because knowledge is power. Now, if you don't remember anything I've said up till now, that's ok. But try to remember what I'm about to say because I believe it comes with a guarantee, unlike the bit about the Grammys. And here it is: Don't be a musical snob. Early on in my career I played in Chuck Berry's band and Neil Diamond's band not too long after that (not together, but—) I got fired from both gigs. You know why? Because I had no respect for music that only had a couple of simple chords in it. I came from a classical and jazz background and I thought that that music was way beneath me. These were two of the best songwriters of the last 50 years, but I didn't want to play no stinking C-F-G. There was no dignity in playing C-F-G. But C-F-G can be very dignified when played the right way and, more importantly, with the right attitude. So I made two mistakes at the same time. 'I have no respect for your music, but I'll take your money.' Don't be a musical snob. Here's the bad news. I can go back to L.A. tonight and put together a big band with the greatest players in the world. I can have them play a rehearsal tomorrow all day and then play for my daughter's wedding tomorrow night from 8:00 p.m. till midnight. I can even have them play for my uncle to sing a couple of songs and he can't even carry a tune in a bucket. I'll pay them 300 bucks, and they'll hope that I give them the check that night. They'll get in their 10-year-old car and drive to their three-bedroom rental in the valley and hope that I call again. Why do some musicians get all the great gigs and opportunities and others get the weddings? It's not talent. It's attitude. Probably every keyboard player here today plays better than I do. And although that's impressive, it won't take you to the top. But attitude will. And if you look at every single thing that comes your way as an opportunity, that will take you to the top, too. Here are a couple of examples. Dennis Quaid, Bruce Willis, and Russell Crowe all have rock and roll bands. None of them are very good. One of them has asked you to be in their band, but you don't like their music or the guys in their band. But they make movies and you want to score movies. You're not going to start scoring movies because you gave somebody at Warner Brothers a tape. You're going to get the break of your life because you said yes with great pride to Dennis Quaid's C-F-G band. And you and Dennis are going to write the theme song for that movie and you're going to love it. Sting's 13-year-old daughter wants to play drums. His nanny is your neighbor. She knows you're a drummer. She doesn't know you're the next Steve Gadd or Jeff Porcaro. She just knows you're a drummer. She wants to know if you'll give Sting's daughter lessons. You bet you will. Even if you're a piano player. Because one day Sting is going to hear you play and one day his drummer is going to have the flu. And you're going to get the gig! What you say no to is just as important as what you say yes to. Either of these events could change your life forever. I don't need to give you more examples. You get the idea. Don't be a musical snob. I guarantee you that Kenny G and Herb Alpert are just as fulfilled as John Coltrane and Miles Davis. All of them got to play their own music exactly the way they wanted and all of them got to maximize their musical capabilities. Don't be a musical snob. I wanted to put a big band together as a present for Kenny G for his 10th wedding anniversary. He said no. He said those guys always look down on him and make him feel uncomfortable. Sixteen guys missed out on making their car payment because of their attitude. Here's another thing. As you start having success, be humble and be grateful. Always have mentors and always try to be a good and kind mentor to others. One of the most memorable moments of my life was when I went to see Stan Getz and Gary Burton play in Vancouver. My friend and I were about 14, and we couldn't believe that we got backstage afterwards. To this day I have the photo of my friend holding Stan Getz's sax and me holding Gary's mallets. Gary is, as you know, one of the greatest and most gifted musical forces on our planet. He was so nice that day and so giving of his time. I was in awe. Little did he realize that he was laying the groundwork for getting me here today, some 38 years later. So be nice. You never know what effect it will have on somebody or how it may come back to you, tenfold. You know, the message that I'm trying to get across obviously has to be tempered with your own integrity and instincts, but I hope I'm getting the point across. These musical choices that you're going to have to make—right or wrong, good or bad—are going to be determining factors in what kind of life you ultimately have. Weigh every decision carefully. If you don't know the answer, wait until tomorrow. I must confess that I've done my share of crappy gigs. I remember playing in this bar every night with this singer. One day at rehearsal I said to him, Tonight, when we do that song, let's (tells story). But what we're really talking about here is some pretty basic stuff. Hard work, kindness, openness, opportunity. You can't count on that thing called luck. Someone once said, The harder I worked, the luckier I got. I think luck is when talent and preparation meet opportunity. Actually, if you really get down to basics, we could all just follow the kindergarten rules and be winners. Share everything. Play fair. Don't hit people. Clean up your own mess. Don't take things that aren't yours. Say you're sorry when you hurt somebody. Wash your hands before you eat. Flush. Live a balanced life. Draw. Paint. Sing. Dance. Play and work some everyday. Take naps, and one of my own that I'll throw in: be nice to nerds because chances are you'll end up working for one. At one time in my life, my dream was to go to Berklee College of Music. My dream got sidetracked, but yours didn't. For those of you that are here on scholarships, no words of mine can describe how you must feel today. For those of you whose parents paid for you to go to this school, I applaud you and your parents. For those of you who worked at night and on the weekends to put yourself here, you don't need to listen to my speech. You already get it. Getting an education at this incredible school is priceless, but Berklee or any other music school is no calling card for success. The folks that run the music business don't care where you got your education or even if you got an education. But let me give you some good news! I think this is a great time to be coming into the music business. The people that complain about the business being too tough are people who aren't tough enough to be in the business. People my age say I had to get out of the biz. It's gotten too hard. Well, they didn't want to get out. They had to get out because the business moved past them. Yes, it's tougher today for me at 52 than at 22, but it's not as tough as it's going to be at 72. Puff Daddy doesn't think it's tough. He's having the time of his life. That young jazz trumpet player that I saw on Leno the other night doesn't think it's hard. He's thinking he died and went to heaven. It can be done and you can do it. The digital world is now penetrating lifestyles in a click of a mouse. The music giants are all fighting for a piece of this pie. I can tell you this: the people running the music business are smart. It will be settled. It will be cultivated. And the form of payment will get straightened out and you will be the beneficiaries of this phenomenal evolution. There are 500 TV channels and they all need content. There's ProTools. You can make an album in your bedroom now. And there's always going to be an audience for good music. You're the next generation of music makers and I believe it's all there for the taking. And we need you. But please don't worry about how many notes you can put into a bar. Worry about how long your music will be around after you're gone. My final thought is this: there's a show on TV called The Young and the Restless and that's exactly what you're supposed to be right now. But there's also a saying that is truer than you could ever imagine at age 22: Life is short. 22 turns to 32 to 42 to 72 faster than you could ever imagine. In fact, we call the TV show The Young and the Rest of Us. So spend your time wisely. Don't dick off too much. Work hard. Play hard and do not get to your last breath and go, I wish I had just— or I should have— or If I had only— You're living in the greatest time ever in the greatest country in the world, but for the first time in the history of the world—a few billion years to be exact—we have the technology to blow this entire planet to bits with one flick of a switch. So try to change that if you can and while you're out saving the planet, treat every day like it's your last one, because one day you are going to be right. Until then, three words from one of the greatest philosophers ever. Nike: 'Just do it.'\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"Thank you very much, President [Roger H.] Brown, to the faculty, to everybody who is responsible for me being here, to my friend and brother [assistant chair of music business/management] John Kellogg. This is such a terrific honor for me. I had the great joy of coming here last evening to witness a concert that I thought was so awesome. I mean, it was awesome. I am a real advocate for music being in our schools. I've even spoken to Congress about doing whatever we can to get music back into our elementary schools, into our high schools, into our inner city schools. Because music is such a wonderful, wonderful tool—not only music, but any artistic form of expression—for our kids to have and to know. It gives them mind occupation and keeps them off the streets in many instances, and I wish so much that the programs can be reinitiated in all of our schools. I'm a real advocate for that. I was here last night and I enjoyed the concert so much. They sang and played some of my music and I thought it was so wonderful. I noticed in a couple of songs the words had been changed, but heck, I said, 'This school is really on top of it, because it's teaching the kids artistic freedom, creativity, adaptation.' I loved it. It was wonderful. Someone asked me back in the reception room if I had ever received an honorary doctorate before. I told them yes, but this one is so very, very special because it's like I'm getting a doctorate from my peers. When people who are embracing music and who love music recognize you, that's unbeatable. So this is really, really, really, really special for me, and I appreciate it so very much. I appreciate being here among you and seeing you and hearing you play and sing. You are awesome. I think it's so ironic that in my life I have been given awards and things like that for doing what I absolutely love. I grew up in the hood in Detroit and my wildest dream was to be in show business—something that I thought was absolutely never going to happen because of where I grew up. But it was my dream and I am very, very, very blessed because I get a chance to live my dream. It's ironic to me that people give me awards and doctorates and things like that for doing what I love. Heck, I would do this for nothing. I have done it for nothing, really. It's so ironic that it's happening like this but it is. First of all, I want to say to you: Never ever give up on your dreams, because your dreams are you. They're what you really want for yourself. So many times people are forced into situations where they have to live lives and do work and do things that are not really their dreams. I assure you that when you live your dream, when you get a chance to earn your living, living your dream, you cannot beat that. So if it happens for you, embrace that with your entire being. It's a wonderful life. Music just happens to be the international language. Music is understood all over the world. No matter what you do or where you go, people enjoy music. It brings people together. Here is a quick example of what I'm talking about. There were many Latin-speaking people here last night playing their music. And it was so awesome. I just love all kinds of music, from classical to gut-bucket blues to rap to hip-hop to whatever, because I love music and I enjoy listening to music every day. But many times when I've gone to other countries to perform the promoters will, after the convert that night, take you to what is the in spot in that particular city or town to enjoy yourself. So we go to this little club there, and we're in Spain. They have a band up on the stage and they're playing and the guy is singing: 'Now if you feel that you can't go on. Because all your hope is gone.' You close your eyes because you think you're listening to Levi Stubbs. He is just on. The Four Tops are up singing there if you close your eyes. So when they came off, I went over to the guy and I said, 'Hey man. That was awesome.' And he said, 'No comprende.' He knew every word to that song verbatim, every word, and he didn't even understand English. Music is the international language. You are embarking upon a life where you can speak to people all over the world. People who don't even speak your given language will understand you through your music. So, go for it. I mean that. It's so good to see that some of you are doing the business end of music. All of you should. It is show business. It's not just going out and having a good time and not paying attention to what's going on with your business as far as what you're doing. That was going on in the old days, even before I got started. So many artists were being duped out of their money and their royalties and things like that because they were not taking care of their business. And it is show business. Thank God for Berry Gordy, who started a record company where young talent could come along and be paid for their creativity. It's such a joy to me to be and to have been a part of the Motown movement. We are now in the process of having a three-year celebration—we started last year but it's going to go until 2010 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the advent of Motown records. I'm very proud, because that started about 15 years or so before I was born [laughter] . . . No, I was there on the very first day. I grew up at Motown. It has been a wonderful life experience. For those of you who are embarking upon being artists in this business, I go and I speak everywhere and I speak at many, many places all the time. When I go and speak to young people who are thinking about being in show business and thinking about what that means, I want to say to you first of all: Never, ever get full of yourself. Never, ever think that you're it. Because if anything, you're blessed. You're getting the chance to live a life that you love. I don't trip on Smokey Robinson. I'm just a very blessed man who is getting a chance to live a life that I love. Creativity is blessing. It's something that's a gift to you from God that you have that is special for you. God gives everybody gifts. Some people never find out what their gifts are. Some people never know what their gifts are. But you do. You know what your gift is. You're gifted with the love of music and with your ability to write it and to play it and to perform it. I have a story that I made up that I tell young people about show business. I call it the story of 'Ubla.' Ubla was a man who was a member of the very first tribe of people on earth, the very first people on earth. And in his little gathering, in his village, men have always imitated the animals. We imitate the animals when we dance and we sing and do things like that. We sing like the birds, we dance, and some people have been known throughout history to wear feathers like the animals. So, we have imitated them. In Ubla's village there was a coyote that used to come to the rock every night and bay at the moon, and all the villagers would come out to see the coyote bay at the moon. [imitates howling] One night, the coyote did not show up. Ubla was waiting there. The coyote did not show up so Ubla got up on the rock and he started to bay at the moon. [imitates howling] And the people recognized the fact that it didn't sound like the regular coyote so they all came out to see who was baying at the moon. It was Ubla up on the rock. When Ubla finished baying at the moon he didn't see them. And he looked down and there they were. And they looked up at him and said, 'Uh.' That was the beginning of show business. You didn't start it and you are not going to finish it, so never, ever get to the point where you think that you're that important, that once the world has become aware of you, it cannot do without your talent. Show business is a very fickle life. You're up today, you're down tomorrow. You're in today, you're out tomorrow. It's a life of peaks and valleys. Let your valley inspire you to get to the next peak. And if you have a lot peaks in a row, don't take yourself so seriously that you think that you're it. You're blessed. You're getting the chance to do something that you love and earn a living at it. And I say Godspeed to all of you. Go out and do it. Because I got a taste last night of what you can do and of who you are, and I'm so proud of you and I'm so happy to be here today. I'm so proud to be getting this doctorate from your school. It is a school of music. It is a school of my life. I'm so proud to be here and I'm so happy. I say God bless all of you.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"Thank you very much. Madam Chancellor, members of the Board of Trustees, members of the faculty and administration, parents and friends, honored guests and graduates, thank you for inviting me to speak today at this magnificent Commencement ceremony. There’s a story about a man and a woman who have been married for 40 years. One evening at dinner the woman turns to her husband and says, “You know, 40 years ago on our wedding day you told me that you loved me and you haven’t said those words since.” They sit in silence for a long moment before the husband says “If I change my mind, I’ll let you know.” Well, it’s been a long time since I sat where you sit, and I can remember looking up at my teachers with great admiration, with fondness, with gratitude and with love. Some of the teachers who were there that day are here this day and I wanted to let them know that I haven’t changed my mind. There’s another story. Two newborn babies are lying side by side in the hospital and they glance at each other. Ninety years later, through a remarkable coincidence, the two are back in the same hospital lying side by side in the same hospital room. They look at each other and one of them says, “So what’d you think?” It’s going to be a very long time before you have to answer that question, but time shifts gears right now and starts to gain speed. Just ask your parents whose heads, I promise you, are exploding right now. They think they took you home from the maternity ward last month. They think you learned how to walk last week. They don’t understand how you could possibly be getting a degree in something today. They listened to “Cats in the Cradle” the whole car ride here. I’d like to say to the parents that I realized something while I was writing this speech: the last teacher your kids will have in college will be me. And that thought scared the hell out of me. Frankly, you should feel exactly the same way. But I am the father of an 11-year-old daughter, so I do know how proud you are today, how proud your daughters and your sons make you every day, and that they did just learn how to walk last week, that you’ll never not be there for them, that you love them more than they’ll ever know and that it doesn’t matter how many degrees get put in their hand, they will always be dumber than you are. And make no mistake about it, you are dumb. You’re a group of incredibly well-educated dumb people. I was there. We all were there. You’re barely functional. There are some screw-ups headed your way. I wish I could tell you that there was a trick to avoiding the screw-ups, but the screw-ups, they’re a-coming for ya. It’s a combination of life being unpredictable, and you being super dumb. Today is May 13th and today you graduate. Growing up, I looked at my future as a timeline of graduations in which every few years, I’d be given more freedom and reward as I passed each milestone of childhood. When I get my driver’s license, my life will be like this; when I’m a senior, my life will be like that; when I go off to college, my life will be like this; when I move out of the dorms, my life will be like that; and then finally, graduation. And on graduation day, I had only one goal left, and that was to be part of professional theater. We have this in common, you and I—we want to be able to earn a living doing what we love. Whether you’re a writer, mathematician, engineer, architect, butcher, baker or candlestick maker, you want an invitation to the show. Today is May 13th, and today you graduate, and today you already know what I know: to get where you’re going, you have to be good, and to be good where you’re going, you have to be damned good. Every once in a while, you’ll succeed. Most of the time you’ll fail, and most of the time the circumstances will be well beyond your control. When we were casting my first movie, “A Few Good Men,” we saw an actor just 10 months removed from the theater training program at UCLA. We liked him very much and we cast him in a small, but featured role as an endearingly dimwitted Marine corporal. The actor had been working as a Domino’s Pizza delivery boy for 10 months, so the news that he’d just landed his first professional job and that it was in a new movie that Rob Reiner was directing, starring Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson, was met with happiness. But as is often the case in show business, success begets success before you’ve even done anything, and a week later the actor’s agent called. The actor had been offered the lead role in a new, as-yet-untitled Milos Forman film. He was beside himself. He felt loyalty to the first offer, but Forman after all was offering him the lead. We said we understood, no problem, good luck, we’ll go with our second choice. Which, we did. And two weeks later, the Milos Forman film was scrapped. Our second choice, who was also making his professional debut, was an actor named Noah Wyle. Noah would go on to become one of the stars of the television series “ER” and hasn’t stopped working since. I don’t know what the first actor is doing, and I can’t remember his name. Sometimes, just when you think you have the ball safely in the end zone, you’re back to delivering pizzas for Domino’s. Welcome to the NFL. In the summer of 1983, after I graduated, I moved to New York to begin my life as a struggling writer. I got a series of survival jobs that included bartending, ticket-taking, telemarketing, limo driving, and dressing up as a moose to pass out leaflets in a mall. I ran into a woman who’d been a senior here when I was a freshman. I asked her how it was going and how she felt Syracuse had prepared her for the early stages of her career. She said, “Well, the thing is, after three years you start to forget everything they taught you in college. But once you’ve done that, you’ll be fine.” I laughed because I thought it was funny and also because I wanted to ask her out, but I also think she was wrong. As a freshman drama student—and this story is now becoming famous—I had a play analysis class—it was part of my requirement. The professor was Gerardine Clark. (applause) If anybody was wondering, the drama students are sitting over there (applause). The play analysis class met for 90 minutes twice a week. We read two plays a week and we took a 20-question true or false quiz at the beginning of the session that tested little more than whether or not we’d read the play. The problem was that the class was at 8:30 in the morning, it met all the way down on East Genesee, I lived all the way up at Brewster/Boland, and I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but from time to time the city of Syracuse experiences inclement weather. All this going to class and reading and walking through snow, wind chill that’s apparently powered by jet engines, was having a negative effect on my social life in general and my sleeping in particular. At one point, being quizzed on “Death of a Salesman,” a play I had not read, I gave an answer that indicated that I wasn’t aware that at the end of the play the salesman dies. And I failed the class. I had to repeat it my sophomore year; it was depressing, frustrating and deeply embarrassing. And it was without a doubt the single most significant event that occurred in my evolution as a writer. I showed up my sophomore year and I went to class, and I paid attention, and we read plays and I paid attention, and we discussed structure and tempo and intention and obstacle, possible improbabilities, improbable impossibilities, and I paid attention, and by God when I got my grades at the end of the year, I’d turned that F into a D. I’m joking: it was pass/fail. But I stood at the back of the Eisenhower Theater at the Kennedy Center in Washington watching a pre-Broadway tryout of my plays, knowing that when the curtain came down, I could go back to my hotel room and fix the problem in the second act with the tools that Gerry Clark gave me. Eight years ago, I was introduced to Arthur Miller at a Dramatists Guild function and we spent a good part of the evening talking. A few weeks later when he came down with the flu he called and asked if I could fill in for him as a guest lecturer at NYU. The subject was “Death of a Salesman.” You made a good decision coming to school here. I’ve made some bad decisions. I lost a decade of my life to cocaine addiction. You know how I got addicted to cocaine? I tried it. The problem with drugs is that they work, right up until the moment that they decimate your life. Try cocaine, and you’ll become addicted to it. Become addicted to cocaine, and you will either be dead, or you will wish you were dead, but it will only be one or the other. My big fear was that I wasn’t going to be able to write without it. There was no way I was going to be able to write without it. Last year I celebrated my 11-year anniversary of not using coke. (applause) Thank you. In that 11 years, I’ve written three television series, three movies, a Broadway play, won the Academy Award and taught my daughter all the lyrics to “Pirates of Penzance.” I have good friends. You’ll meet a lot of people who, to put it simply, don’t know what they’re talking about. In 1970 a CBS executive famously said that there were four things that we would never, ever see on television: a divorced person, a Jewish person, a person living in New York City and a man with a moustache. By 1980, every show on television was about a divorced Jew who lives in New York City and goes on a blind date with Tom Selleck. Develop your own compass, and trust it. Take risks, dare to fail, remember the first person through the wall always gets hurt. My junior and senior years at Syracuse, I shared a five-bedroom apartment at the top of East Adams with four roommates, one of whom was a fellow theater major named Chris. Chris was a sweet guy with a sly sense of humor and a sunny stage presence. He was born out of his time, and would have felt most at home playing Mickey Rooney’s sidekick in “Babes on Broadway.” I had subscriptions back then to Time and Newsweek. Chris used to enjoy making fun of what he felt was an odd interest in world events that had nothing to do with the arts. I lost touch with Chris after we graduated and so I’m not quite certain when he died. But I remember about a year and a half after the last time I saw him, I read an article in Newsweek about a virus that was burning its way across the country. The Centers for Disease Control was calling it “Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome” or AIDS for short. And they were asking the White House for $35 million for research, care and cure. The White House felt that $35 million was way too much money to spend on a disease that was only affecting homosexuals, and they passed. Which I’m sure they wouldn’t have done if they’d known that $35 million was a steal compared to the $2 billion it would cost only 10 years later. Am I saying that Chris would be alive today if only he’d read Newsweek? Of course not. But it seems to me that more and more we’ve come to expect less and less of each other, and that’s got to change. Your friends, your family, this school expect more of you than vocational success. Today is May 13th and today you graduate and the rules are about to change, and one of them is this: Decisions are made by those who show up. Don’t ever forget that you’re a citizen of this world. Don’t ever forget that you’re a citizen of this world, and there are things you can do to lift the human spirit, things that are easy, things that are free, things that you can do every day. Civility, respect, kindness, character. You’re too good for schadenfreude, you’re too good for gossip and snark, you’re too good for intolerance—and since you’re walking into the middle of a presidential election, it’s worth mentioning that you’re too good to think people who disagree with you are your enemy. Unless they went to Georgetown, in which case, they can go to hell. (Laughter) Don’t ever forget that a small group of thoughtful people can change the world. It’s the only thing that ever has. Rehearsal’s over. You’re going out there now, you’re going to do this thing. How you live matters. You’re going to fall down, but the world doesn’t care how many times you fall down, as long as it’s one fewer than the number of times you get back up. For the class of 2012, I wish you joy. I wish you health and happiness and success, I wish you a roof, four walls, a floor and someone in your life that you care about more than you care about yourself. Someone who makes you start saying “we” where before you used to say “I” and “us” where you used to say “me.” I wish you the quality of friends I have and the quality of colleagues I work with. Baseball players say they don’t have to look to see if they hit a home run, they can feel it. So I wish for you a moment—a moment soon—when you really put the bat on the ball, when you really get a hold of one and drive it into the upper deck, when you feel it. When you aim high and hit your target, when just for a moment all else disappears, and you soar with wings as eagles. The moment will end as quickly as it came, and so you’ll have to have it back, and so you’ll get it back no matter what the obstacles. A lofty prediction, to be sure, but I flat out guarantee it. Today is May 13th, and today you graduate, and my friends, you ain’t seen nothin’ yet. Thank you, and congratulations.\"\n",

    "         'transcript': \"I'm so happy to be here today. Now, I don't want you to worry about looking silly in these mortarboards. It's kind of a funny tradition, isn't it? Congratulations! You've spent the last four years slavishly working your heart out, you've got the entire faculty and all your family assembled here, now slap this flat thing on your head and go out there and look proud. Well, you should be proud. I'm proud of you. Perhaps we should just decide that you're wearing these to teach you something about balance, the key to a happy life. You can use that if you want. Life's a funny thing, isn't it? As I look out at all of you today, I ask myself, How did I get here? I know, but how is it that I find myself standing in front of what can only be called an assembly, a captive audience, saying what's on my mind? It's surprising. But life is surprising and that's a good thing, because it's nice to know that when you least expect it, things can take a sudden turn for the better. You can actually have the life that you think only happens to other people. Isn't that wonderful? Now, at this moment you all are going through an experience I never had. I didn't graduate from college. No, I was dedicating my life to the theatre and God forbid I should muddy the artistic waters with anything as unromantic as an actual college degree! And to this day, if pressed, I can still get my mother to say, ...but you'd just feel so much better about yourself if you'd just finish! And you know what, Mom? You're right, but whenever I start feeling those pangs, I just go in my office, close the door and clutch my Oscar till it passes. But knowing I was going to be here today got me thinking about the time in my life when I left college. I had just spent three and a half years studying drama--at Purdue University, a school known for having the best...agriculture and engineering departments in the Midwest. Much the same as going to study quantum physics at Juilliard. My sister drove up to help me move my stuff. She came into my apartment and said, Holy mother of God, this is gonna take two trips. Does that sound familiar to anyone at all? All that stuff, and I don't have any of it now. But I was thinking about that time in my life when I was the age that most of you are now, and I couldn't help but think, Boy, if I knew then what I know now, things would have been a lot different. Because I'll tell you the truth, when I left school, I didn't know what I was doing. I thought I did. I had a plan, or a semblance of a plan, but between then and now, I was led or went willingly down several varieties of garden path. I made some wrong turns, U-turns, did donuts in the parking lot, went uphill, downhill and sometimes I just coasted. I traveled a lot of roads, and once or twice I even made a road where there was no road before. The point is, as misguided as it seemed at the time, it all added up to something. Cumulatively, it added up to a life that's happier for the distance I've traveled, wiser for the mistakes I've made, stronger for the things I've overcome, richer for the experience I've earned, some of which I'd probably trade back for the time, but maybe not. Now, understand, I'm not recommending my path to you. If you can hop on the straight and narrow, by all means, do that. But along the way, I learned some things that I thought I'd pass along to you in the hope that maybe, at the very least, I could save you some time. One of the wisest things I learned in college was something that I read on a bathroom wall, which I know is a pretty sad statement, but one that taught me to take your wisdom where you can find it. And what it said was: Recognize your limitations, and sure enough, they're yours. Now this really stayed with me through the years and I'm glad I had the good fortune to read it. Because the world will provide you with every imaginable obstacle, but the one most difficult to overcome will be the lack of faith in yourself. Leave it to others to have doubts about you. In fact, I suggest keeping a list of those names, because later on, when you've succeeded beyond your wildest expectations, you can drop them a line, thanking them for their support. I didn't start writing until I was 30 years old. And the thing that's odd about that is that before that, if you could get me to tell you my deepest, darkest secret, my private, foolish dream, I would have told you that I had a sneaking suspicion that I could write. But truthfully, I was afraid. I was afraid that I couldn't do it, that I wouldn't be good enough, that I would make a fool of myself. I was worried about what people would think of me. And this brings me to my first big tip: DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE WILL THINK OF YOU, because first of all, they're not thinking about you. In all likelihood, they're worried about what you're thinking about them. Anybody who thinks less of you for following a dream isn't worth worrying about anyway. They're probably just envious because it takes a lot of courage to follow your heart and your instincts, and it's not always pretty, and it's not for the fainthearted but it leads right into my next, and maybe most important tip which is: DON'T BE AFRAID TO HAVE A DREAM. Because one of the most amazing things about this life is that dreams can become reality, and I offer myself as living proof. With perseverance, faith, and luck, and by luck I mean, when opportunity meets preparation, truly incredible things can happen to you. I promise you one thing. It won't be easy, but it's easier than spending your life wishing that you'd done something, and feeling disappointed in yourself for never having tried. That's the true hell. So go on and do the thing that scares the hell out of you, because in this world, not unlike Hollywood, the gamble is almost as safe a bet as the sure thing. And also, when you give yourself the gift of quietly believing in yourself, you'll love yourself. And now for another tip. It is of paramount importance for you to figure out as soon as possible that YOU MUST DO THINGS THAT MAKE YOU LOVE YOURSELF. I'm sure you've all heard the line, If you don't first love yourself, you can never truly love anyone else. Well, that's true. No one in the world can solve the problems of one who does not love herself, and you can spend years thinking that if someone could just love me the right way, then everything will be okay. And that's true, it's just that that someone is you. Because I know so well how easy it is to be hard on yourself, too hard, and how unforgiving one can be when it comes to one's own shortcomings. And of course, some healthy self-criticism is good, but I also know how negative voices inside you can get carried away, until that's all you hear. So here's a little reality check, a little systems analysis you can run just to see if you may be bearing down on yourself a little too hard. Would you have a friend who talks to you the way you talk to yourself? Would you say to a friend the kind of things that you say to yourself? For instance, let's say you, like I, perpetually misplace your keys. In fact, except for the few moments that they are actually in my hand, my keys are always lost, and by now, if you rack up all the hours I've spent looking for them, I could have learned a language or become proficient on a musical instrument. I could have gone into politics, and maybe even become president, but I couldn't, because I couldn't find my keys. Now, I happen to know that in my case this is an inherited characteristic passed down on my mother's side, and from what I understand, researchers at Stanford are very close to isolating the lost key gene, and I'm on the list to have gene replacement therapy so as not to pass it on to my own offspring. But do you, when looking for your keys find yourself saying things to yourself like, You idiot! You're just lucky your head's sewn on! Why can't you just figure out how to put them in one place? I can't believe how STUPID you are, you stupid, stupid idiot! or do you say, Now, let's see, where would someone who's got really important things on her mind, leave her keys? See what I'm getting at? Don't listen to things from yourself that you wouldn't accept from a friend. You wouldn't want a friend who wasn't supportive, so don't accept any less from yourself. You're only human, so learn to forgive yourself the little things, and do the best you can on the big things. No one is perfect, and expecting perfection from yourself or anyone else is a waste of time. Now, what if you don't have a dream? Some of you may be sitting there thinking, What in the hell is she talking about? I have no idea, not the foggiest idea what I should do with my life! and I want to speak to this, because I think that this may be the single most difficult dilemma that you will ever be faced with. And one that garners no sympathy from those more fortunate, who have always known what they wanted to do. There are those who will say you're simply lazy, and you may come to believe this about yourself. All I'm going to tell you is try anything and everything, search high and low until you find something, not somebody, something that you love. Time is like money. Invest now in yourself for a big dividend later. You're going to have to be in it for the long haul, exactly like everyone else, but know that doors will open to you that you didn't even know were there. Some of you may be overcome with the feeling that there's something you're supposed to be doing, but you just don't know what it is. That happens. But if you're going to pray for anything in your life, pray that you be put on your proper path, because life lived with a sense of purpose and commitment is just a lot more rewarding than one that drifts. So: DO find a cause, something you believe in, and get behind it. This world is in a lot of trouble, and it needs all the help it can get. DON'T sit on the sidelines wishing things would change, wishing this were a different kind of world. It can be a different kind of world, but it's gonna take a lot of women exactly like you to help change it. And you can. And I don't want to hear any back talk about it. Now, I'll give you a little piece of advice that my mother, thankfully, gave me, and that is: No matter what it is you decide to do, make sure that you choose something that will provide you with an income on which you can take care of yourself. Yes, right after she told me that I decided to go into acting, but as time went on, I realized the value of her words. Now don't worry about being poor in your twenties. It's a pain, but you can work with it. But later on, it's more difficult, and there's not a lot of glory in being an adult dependent. But, there is a lot of satisfaction in knowing you can make your own way in the world. Self-sufficiency is an extremely worthwhile goal. You have to know now that you can survive anything and should all else fail, you can make it on your own and be happy. Thanks, Mom. Now, you know how they always tell you that later, when you're older, your face will clear up? It won't. I'm just gonna tell you that now so you can get on with your life. I'm still waiting to lose my baby fat. I've waited my whole life to gradually grow into looking exactly like Claudia Schiffer, and I can see now that it's not going to happen. Maybe some of you do that. Maybe some of you spend time looking into the mirror, thinking, I'm too fat! or, in extremely rare cases, I'm too thin! I'm sure that each one of you could give me a fairly detailed list of your physical imperfections, as I could do the same about myself. Here's a really important tip, and you might want to write this one down: FOR EVERY FIVE MINUTES YOU SPEND LOOKING INTO A MIRROR, SPEND FIVE TIMES THAT AMOUNT OF TIME LOOKING OUT AT THE WORLD. In reality, your happiness has a lot more to do with how you see the world than how the world sees you. Time is our most limited resource. Don't waste it on things that aren't important. How you look is not nearly as important as who you are. If you want to learn to make yourself beautiful, do it from the inside out. Do what I did--learn to make it on your personality. Personality is the one quality that doesn't fade with time. There was a parish, where the old pastor was retiring and a new pastor was coming in. The pastor arrived, and she was a woman. Three of the older men in the church had taken the old pastor fishing every Thursday afternoon and they said, well, we always took him fishing, let's take her fishing. So Thursday morning they load up the boat and out they go. A quiet day, but round about four o'clock the fish really start biting. The pastor says, This is great, guys, but unfortunately, I've got to get back. They say, Well, that's too bad. We're not leaving while the fish are biting like this. And she says, Well, I'm sorry, but I've got a meeting at five. And they say, Well, we're sorry. You're just gonna have to swim. And she says, Well, I have no intention of swimming, and she steps out of the boat and walks across the water back to shore. The guys just look at each other and one of 'em says, Look at that. They send us a woman pastor and she can't even swim. You may encounter something like this in your upcoming foray into the world. You have been lucky so far, because you've been here for four years, where no one takes points off because of your gender. I wish so much that I could tell you that the world is free of sexism and that you will be judged only on the content of your character, not on the contents of your bra. But some of you will not find it so. I come to you today as a feminist speaker...and it disturbs me to hear women, especially young women, distancing themselves from the word feminist. I think they do it because there's a tendency to forget what the term means. It means, simply, A doctrine advocating social, political, and economic rights for women equal to those of men. Anybody here have a problem with that? What it does not mean is anything pertaining to or associated with Lorena Bobbitt. It makes as much sense to include Lorena Bobbitt in a discussion of feminism as it does to include Jeffrey Dahmer in a discussion of vegetarianism. Feminists are often portrayed in the media as the female equivalent of a gorilla; hairy, dangerous, and unpredictable. This is a frightening characterization not only to men, but to women as well, and one that causes some to want to distance themselves from the term. Another characterization is that feminists are women who want to be men. I'm here to say that feminism is the path that allowed me to take pride in being a woman. It is a movement to give value to women and their work--in and out of the home--not to diminish the value of men. The idea that the interests of women exist in opposition to men is nonsensical. Feminism is not based on the superiority of the gender, but rather on the removal of limitations based on gender. And if you agree with that, I've got some good news for you. You're a feminist. I'm often asked what I do when faced with blatant sexism. I'm told, by many young women especially, that they feel that many of the young men they encounter are openly disrespectful toward them. On the rare occasions that that happens to me, I understand that it comes from a deficiency in him, a flaw in his character, not mine. When someone treats me in that way, I try to keep in mind that, in most cases, it probably stems more from ignorance, from some misplaced fear, than from real prejudice. Also, there is quite a bit of subtle, and not so subtle conditioning that goes on, that sends the message that it's okay to speak to, and treat women disrespectfully. I try to give them the benefit of the doubt. But what I do not do, is let it pass. Any more than I would let pass discrimination based on race, color, or religion, I do not tolerate it. I do not excuse it. If I accept it, it's bad for me and it's bad for him. And I'm telling you: the only way sexism can truly harm you is if you get used to it. Don't ever get used to it. In the next few years, you're going to be getting a lot of advice. A lot of you are going to be dealing with parents and family that have your future all mapped out in their minds, and it may not have anything to do with who you are and what you want. In fact, your parents may seem not to know you at all, but you know what? Maybe they do. Possibly, they can see things in you that you can't see in yourself. And they have the experience of having been on the planet longer than you. They've seen more of what can go wrong. So here's another really fabulous tip: LISTEN WITH AN OPEN HEART AND AN OPEN MIND TO THOSE WHO LOVE YOU THE MOST. You may hear a grain of truth that will later become the foundation of your entire belief system. My father told me that I would only find true happiness through accomplishment and fully realizing my potential. At the time, that sounded like one of those crummy things your father says while you're waiting for him to hand over the car keys (right before you're about to do something awful). It has nothing to do with your daily reality. But now, of course, I'm happiest when I'm accomplishing something that takes all of my best effort, where I feel I'm living up to my potential. My mother told me that I would feel deeply rewarded just by the act of completing something. Thelma and Louise was the first thing, that was totally my own, that I ever completed. Your parents may not know everything, but neither do you. Hear them out. And, parents: please, whatever mistakes you may see her make, don't lose hope. The faith you have in your daughter will see her through some hard times and help her through the parts where she may lose faith in herself. Again, thanks, Mom. In closing, which I always say to give the audience a shred of hope, I'm going to give you the real down skinny. Here are some of the most important things you're ever gonna need to know: Save yourself several thousand dollars and start flossing like a maniac now. Always, in all circumstances, wear comfortable shoes. You never know when you may have to run for your life. Never wear stockings that are darker than your shoes. Otherwise you get that Minnie Mouse look going and you want to avoid that. Never argue with an idiot. Practice everything in moderation except moderation, which you should practice in excess. Be sure to have a hobby. Marry late. Don't forget to check for change in the coke machine. Keep track of your friends. Life is short, so cram as much fun into it as you possibly can. Be here now, and JUST DO IT. When I first moved to Los Angeles, I was waiting tables in a restaurant in Beverly Hills, and Gloria Steinem came in with another couple. I told the other waitress, excitedly, Gloria Steinem just sat in your section! She said, Who's that? I said, Gimme that table! I waited on her, trying not to come undone, because of course, Gloria Steinem was my idol when I was growing up in Paducah, Kentucky. She was everything that was cool about feminism. And finally at the end, I said, Ms. Steinem, I just want to thank you for everything that you've done. I know that your work has made the world just a little better for the women of my generation, and I just want you to know, I really appreciate it. She very graciously said, It's been my pleasure, but there's so much more to do, so all I ask is that you carry on. And I have been happily trying to oblige ever since. There have been a lot of women and men who have gone before us lighting the way, knocking down walls, opening doors, kicking ass and taking names, so the way for those of us coming up behind them might be just a little bit easier. So today, I ask you to remember them...And with all my high hopes, congratulations, and best wishes for your future...Carry on!\"\n",
